    <title>Obsessive problem solving followed by aimless wandering</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t felt any urge to tinker with my Linux setup in months. This after spending much of the spring
      and into summer furiously and obsessively trying every PC out there to find the perfect replacement for the Mac, diving deep
      with Ubuntu, and codifying my findings in the &lt;a href="https://omakub.org/"&gt;Omakub&lt;/a&gt; project. But now
      it&amp;#39;s done, and I&amp;#39;m left enjoying the Apple-free spoils of a new, better place without any recurring
      work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was the same experience getting out of the cloud. For months, I spent all
      my time building &lt;a href="https://kamal-deploy.org/"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, examining server components, and plotting our
      path. But then &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0"&gt;we did it&lt;/a&gt;, and then
      &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-have-left-the-cloud-251760fb"&gt;it was done&lt;/a&gt;.
      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ditto with &lt;a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2024/11/7/rails-8-no-paas-required"&gt;Rails
      8&lt;/a&gt;. Huge push to get the Solid Trifecta to line up with a release that included Propshaft and the authentication
      generator, and the rest of all the amazing steps forward I covered in &lt;a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cEn_83zRFw&amp;amp;list=PLHFP2OPUpCeb182aDN5cKZTuyjn3Tdbqx&amp;amp;index=1"&gt;the
      Rails World keynote&lt;/a&gt;. Now that&amp;#39;s done too, and all new Rails apps enjoy the compressed
      complexity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the company level, most of our work is a marathon. That&amp;#39;s how you
      stay in business for twenty years and beyond. By sticking with it. But at the executive level, almost all big leaps forward
      are sprints inspired by a hunch. They have to be sprints, because the level of intensity required to get that hunch over the
      hill is just too high to sustain for long (unless, I guess, you&amp;#39;re Elon!).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That to
      me is the best argument for making sure my plate isn&amp;#39;t full of half-eaten commitments. That my calendar
      isn&amp;#39;t clogged with an endless ream of recurring meetings. Such that my mind remains an open, blank slate when one of
      those obsessive opportunities &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-Do-You-Chance/dp/1943200734"&gt;flutter
      by&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;See, I&amp;#39;ve come to accept that my best work is a series of sprints
      punctuated by periods of wandering. It was a knee-jerk protest to &lt;a href="https://www.hey.com/apple/"&gt;the stultifying
      and abusive App Store bureaucracy&lt;/a&gt; that eventually lead me to Linux. And it was discovering Linux that lead to
      Omakub, and making the open source operating system &lt;a
      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/linux-as-the-new-developer-default-at-37signals-ef0823b7"&gt;the default for new technical
      staff at 37signals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a deep dive into Docker, originally without any clear
      mission beyond curiosity, that lead to Kamal, and our path out of the cloud. Oh, and getting enamored by the speed of Gen 4
      SSDs was what planted the seed for the Solid Trifecta. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t have
      planned any of this even if I wanted to. But I also don&amp;#39;t want to. There are few things more satisfying to me than
      following a hunch and seeing where it leads, without a commitment to a specific, final
      destination.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#39;s a little like writing. Half the joy of composing these paragraphs
      come from discovering the arguments as the piece develops. Every essay starts with a hunch, but the final shape is rarely
      clear until the mind has been left to wrestle with the words for a while.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;So that&amp;#39;s
      why my answer to the usual question of &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s next?&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t know! Because if I did,
      I&amp;#39;d already be half-way done doing it. And then it wouldn&amp;#39;t really be next, it&amp;#39;d be
      now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Finding the next now is the art of wandering, and wandering well takes
      practice and patience. Don&amp;#39;t rush it.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>House rules in Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;We play a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.fortnite.com/"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt; at our house. It&amp;#39;s a great
      game for teaching kids cooperative discipline, and in a remarkably wholesome setting to boot (no blood, cartoon styling).
      I&amp;#39;ve had no qualms involving all three of our boys from an early age in the family squad, including our two youngest
      from around age four.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since we started playing, I&amp;#39;ve just had two primary
      house rules:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No
      complaining.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sounds simple, but it&amp;#39;s ever-so tempting to stray from the
      squad to chase your own goal of getting better gear, and it comes easy to blame your brother when the other team gets you.
      Especially when you&amp;#39;re still a preschooler!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that&amp;#39;s why Fortnite is such
      an effective tool for teaching discipline. Because if you want to win in a team-based context like that, you have to work
      together as a team, and you&amp;#39;ll quickly realize that sticking to the rules makes that way more
      likely.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#39;s also teaches you how to lose gracefully. If you get all pissy and
      blamey when you&amp;#39;re knocked out, the session ends, because nobody wants to listen to that (especially dad!). So if
      you want to play more, and get better, you better start tempering your frustrations. Wonderful life skill to develop
      early.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Equally, it&amp;#39;s a delightful game to beat together. Unlike something like Mario
      Kart or Smash Brothers, which pits the family against itself (also fun, but less learning!), Fortnite puts us all on the
      same team, striving for the same objective, and in line to celebrate together when we&amp;#39;re
      successful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you add it all up, it&amp;#39;s one of my favorite activities with the
      kids. It&amp;#39;s highly rewarding to see them internalize both the big life lessons mentioned above, as well as the
      nitty-gritty tactical insights, like always seeking higher ground, securing cover, and having proper backup before
      engaging.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;All screen time is not created equal.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Too much therapy at work</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;Many years ago, Jason and I hired a COO at 37signals, but ended up letting them go after just a year (many
      reasons, another story). This happened not long before one of our company meet-ups, so we thought it fitting to discuss the
      matter in-person. What a mistake. The session turned into a group therapy session lasting hours, with a free-flowing
      out-pour of every anxiety under the sun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some might look at group therapy, with
      its sharing of emotional stories and vulnerability, as a good thing. And I&amp;#39;m sure it can be, in the right setting.
      But that setting is not work. Especially not with the entire company present as
      participants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But that&amp;#39;s where a therapy-infused corporate culture and
      language often leads. It&amp;#39;s a natural extension of &amp;quot;holding the space&amp;quot;, of too much navel-gazing
      &amp;quot;mindfulness&amp;quot;, of a posture of nurture and care that borders the
      patronizing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#39;s okay to be disappointed or frustrated or anxious at work.
      That&amp;#39;s part of the experience working with and especially for other people! But where things go astray is when
      there&amp;#39;s an expectation that these emotions always need to be &lt;em&gt;processed&lt;/em&gt; during the 9-5 by your
      manager (rather than after hours with a licensed therapist).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#39;s also based on a
      fundamental misconception that everything can be made better for everyone by talking more about it. For some people, men
      especially, the better way out of a bad situation is to feel useful. There&amp;#39;s &lt;a
      href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/daniellaemanuel/men-rather-do-than-therapy"&gt;a whole meme&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to
      &amp;quot;men would rather X than go the therapy&amp;quot;, which is posited as a point of derision rather than recognizing
      taking some/any/all actions as a legitimate coping strategy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;See, there&amp;#39;s
      another one of those therapy words: coping. Belonging to the same lexicon as trauma, rumination, and self-care. I&amp;#39;m
      sure these are all useful and helpful labels in the right therapeutic context, but again, that just isn&amp;#39;t work.
      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#39;s a reason licensed therapists are bound by a whole host of ethical
      boundaries when working with clients. They can&amp;#39;t be intertwined with the client&amp;#39;s friends or family or
      colleagues. They must be competent in the specific areas where they recommend interventions. There are all sorts of healthy
      constraints on the relationship.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those constraints can&amp;#39;t apply at work when
      you&amp;#39;re treating the 1-1 as an hour on the Freudian couch or turn the all-hands into a group therapy session.
      It&amp;#39;s the same problem with the excessive pathologizing of children that Abigail Shrier covered so well in her book
      &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CBYHTV2D/"&gt;Bad Therapy&lt;/a&gt; (one of my favorite reads from
      2024!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to read all of the above as cold or dismissive, but
      please don&amp;#39;t. It&amp;#39;s possible to share the same genuine care for people while disagreeing on the methods and
      the context that&amp;#39;s due to serve them best. And it&amp;#39;s also possible to look at the increase in therapy
      thinking, language, and methods in the workplace as an abject failure of modern corporate culture. An increase
      that&amp;#39;s making people more fragile, &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/be-less-precious-b20bf8c3"&gt;more
      precious&lt;/a&gt;, more incapable of coping with the most basic expectations of disappointments or adversity on the
      job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That to me is as sound of a theory for trying something else as you could
      ever have. What we&amp;#39;ve been doing for the last couple of decades is busted, and it&amp;#39;s time to accept that. Get
      therapy out of the office and let&amp;#39;s hand it back to the shrinks.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The spells are spent</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;They just don&amp;#39;t work any more, those baseless accusations that anyone we disagree with is a racist,
      misogynist, fascist. After being invoked en masse and in vain for the better part of the past decade, their power to shock
      and awe is finally gone. All that&amp;#39;s left is a weak whimper. Good fucking
      riddance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The problem with accusations like that is that they eventually have to
      be backed by proof or they&amp;#39;ll bounce like a rubber check. And when even the most mundane political or moral
      positions were able to earn one of those *ist-y labels, the entire enterprise of throwing them around was bound to go
      bankrupt. And now it has.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever controversy calling &lt;a
      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-waning-days-of-dei-s-dominance-9a5b656c"&gt;the peak of DEI&lt;/a&gt; might have
      garnered two years ago is certainly gone now. Being professionally offended by every little thing, seeing micro-aggressions
      around every corner, and rendering the entire world through a narrow oppressed/oppressor lens is back to the niche
      disposition once more.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This particular preference falsification, where people just go along
      with what&amp;#39;s in vogue to keep their head down, has left the zeitgeist. For a hot minute, it really did seem like
      &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; was immersed in critical-theory thinking and the rest of the woke orthodoxies. But that was
      shadows on the wall, distorted to thrice their size from the angle of the light.
      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now the angle has changed, so the shadows have shrunk. That big scary mob that
      once was has been reduced to near impotence in most arenas, including the biggest of all, the US presidential election.
      That&amp;#39;s a win for everyone whether they like Donald Trump or not.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>What you know that just ain't so</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;The fun bit about business is in all the answers you don&amp;#39;t have. Should we be priced higher or lower or
      leave it alone? Should we chase these customers over here or those customers over there? Should we add more features or
      polish the ones we have? There&amp;#39;s endless variation in every one of those questions, and you can&amp;#39;t reason
      your way to conclusion. Only testing against reality will really give you an answer. And even then, reality can be
      &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Meaning that even valid results of your experiments can
      steer you astray. Maybe you ran your pricing test too short to know what the second-order effect of losing sign-ups in favor
      of a higher revenue-per-customer will be, even if it nets out positively for the first year. Maybe presenting your new
      features came with a new website design, and the latter was what actually moved the needle. It&amp;#39;s very hard to reduce
      any interesting question in business to a perfect experiment. Best you usually get is more or less
      confidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Which is fine! We don&amp;#39;t need to know everything for sure
      before taking action. In fact, the hallmark of a good business person is their ability to make calculated bets based on half
      a story and a hunch.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the key is to remember that what you won was a bet, not a trophy
      made of truth. And while you can to be grateful for the good outcome, you need to remember that whatever conclusions you
      draw from it need to remain suspect.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is just as true when you lose the bet.
      That&amp;#39;s when you&amp;#39;re liable to believe that &amp;quot;we tried that, didn&amp;#39;t work&amp;quot; represents
      some universal statement of fact. When in reality, the lesson is more like &amp;quot;we tried SOMETHING and that SOMETHING
      didn&amp;#39;t work&amp;quot;. In order to remember that &amp;quot;we could try SOMETHING ELSE and THAT might
      work&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Because if you don&amp;#39;t, you&amp;#39;ll eventually become a
      prisoner to every bet you&amp;#39;ve made. Convinced that half the opportunities in the world just don&amp;#39;t apply to
      your situation and the other half is a slam dunk. Nonsense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&amp;#39;s okay to
      collect your winnings even if you aren&amp;#39;t exactly sure why you won. It&amp;#39;s okay to take some losses even if you
      can&amp;#39;t explain exactly where it went wrong. In fact, it&amp;#39;s better than okay to resist coming up with a
      definitive story either which way. Because as soon as you write that story down, it tends to become rigid rather than open
      to reinterpretation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;An open mind is always willing to let the story twist,
      willing to revisit the setup, and willing to test everything from timing to premise on another day.&lt;/div&gt;

      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/our-cloud-exit-savings-will-now-top-ten-million-over-five-years-c7d9b5bd" />
    <title>Our cloud-exit savings will now top ten million over five years</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;We &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-have-left-the-cloud-251760fb"&gt;finished&lt;/a&gt; pulling seven
      cloud apps, including &lt;a href="https://hey.com/"&gt;HEY&lt;/a&gt;, out of AWS and onto our own hardware last summer. But
      it took until the end of that year for all the long-term contract commitments to end, so 2024 has been the first clean year
      of savings, and we&amp;#39;ve been pleasantly surprised that they&amp;#39;ve been even better than originally
      estimated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For 2024, we&amp;#39;ve brought the cloud bill down from the original
      $3.2 million/year run rate to $1.3 million. That&amp;#39;s a saving of almost two million dollars per year for our setup!
      The reason it&amp;#39;s more than &lt;a
      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-stand-to-save-7m-over-five-years-from-our-cloud-exit-53996caa"&gt;our original estimate
      of $7 million over five years&lt;/a&gt; is that we got away with putting all the new hardware into our existing data center
      racks and power limits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The expenditure on &lt;a
      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-hardware-we-need-for-our-cloud-exit-has-arrived-99d66966"&gt;all that new Dell
      hardware&lt;/a&gt; – about $700,000 in the end – was also entirely recouped during 2023 while the long-term commitments
      slowly rolled off. Think about that for a second. This is gear we expect to use for the next five, maybe even seven years!
      All paid off from savings accrued during the second half of 2023. Pretty
      sweet!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But it&amp;#39;s about to get sweeter still. The remaining $1.3 million we
      still spend on cloud services is all from AWS S3. While all our former cloud compute and managed database/search services
      were on one-year committed contracts, our file storage has been locked into a four(!!)-year contract since 2021, which
      doesn&amp;#39;t expire until next summer. So that&amp;#39;s when we plan to be out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;We store
      almost 10 petabytes of data in S3 now. That includes a lot of super critical customer files, like for Basecamp and HEY,
      stored in duplicate via separate regions. We use a mixture of storage classes to get an optimized solution that weighs
      reliability, access, and cost. But it&amp;#39;s still well over a million dollars to keep all this data there (and
      that&amp;#39;s after the big long-term commitment discounts!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When we move out
      next summer, we&amp;#39;ll be moving to a dual-DC &lt;a href="https://www.purestorage.com/"&gt;Pure Storage&lt;/a&gt; setup,
      with a combined 18 petabytes of capacity. This setup will cost about the same as a year&amp;#39;s worth of AWS S3 for the
      initial hardware. But thanks to the incredible density and power efficiency of the Pure flash arrays, we can also fit these
      within our existing data center racks. So ongoing costs are going to be some modest service contracts, and we expect to save
      another four million dollars over five years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This brings our total projected
      savings from the combined cloud exit to well over ten million dollars over five years! While getting faster computers and
      much more storage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now, as with all things cloud vs on-prem, it&amp;#39;s never
      fully apples-to-apples. If you&amp;#39;re entirely in the cloud, and have no existing data center racks, you&amp;#39;ll pay
      to rent those as well (but you&amp;#39;ll probably be shocked at how cheap it is compared to the cloud!). And even for our
      savings estimates, the target keeps moving as we require more hardware and more storage as Basecamp and HEY continues to
      grow over the years.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it&amp;#39;s still remarkable that we&amp;#39;re able to reap
      savings of this magnitude from leaving the cloud. We&amp;#39;ve been out for just over a year now, and the team managing
      everything is still the same. There were no hidden dragons of additional workload associated with the exit that required us
      to balloon the team, as some spectators speculated when we announced it. All the answers in our &lt;a
      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-big-cloud-exit-faq-20274010"&gt;Big Cloud Exit FAQ&lt;/a&gt; continue to
      hold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&amp;#39;s still work, though! Running apps the size of &lt;a
      href="https://basecamp.com/"&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; and HEY across two data centers (and soon at least one more
      internationally!) requires a substantial and dedicated crew. There&amp;#39;s always work to be done maintaining all these
      applications, databases, virtual machines, and yes, occasionally, even requesting a power supply or drive swap on a machine
      throwing a warming light (but &lt;a href="https://deft.com/"&gt;our white gloves at Deft&lt;/a&gt; take care of that). But
      most of that work was something we had to do in the cloud as well!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since we originally
      announced &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0"&gt;our plans to leave the
      cloud&lt;/a&gt;, there&amp;#39;s been a &lt;a href="https://x.com/MichaelDell/status/1780672823167742135"&gt;surge of
      interest&lt;/a&gt; in doing the same across the industry. The motto of the 2010s and early 2020s – all-cloud, everything,
      all the time – seems to finally have peaked. And thank heavens for that!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The cloud can still
      make a lot of sense, though. Especially in the very early days when you don&amp;#39;t even need a whole computer or are
      unsure whether you&amp;#39;ll still be in business by the end of the year. Or when you&amp;#39;re dealing with enormous
      fluctuations in load, like what motivated Amazon to create AWS in the first place.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as
      soon as the cloud bills start to become substantial, I think you owe it to yourself, your investors, and common business
      sense to at least do the math. How much are we spending? What would it cost to buy these computers instead of renting them?
      Could we try moving some part of the setup onto our own hardware, maybe using &lt;a
      href="https://kamal-deploy.org/"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; or a similar tool? The potential savings from these answers can be
      shocking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At &lt;a href="https://37signals.com/"&gt;37signals&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;re looking forward to
      literally deleting our AWS account come this summer, but remain grateful for the service and the lessons we learned while
      using the platform. It&amp;#39;s obvious why Amazon continues to lead in cloud. And I&amp;#39;m also grateful that
      it&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/free-data-transfer-out-to-internet-when-moving-out-of-aws/"&gt;now
      entirely free to move your data out of S3&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;#39;re leaving the platform for good. Makes the math even
      better. So long and thanks for all the fish!&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Capture less than you create</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;I beam with pride when I see companies like Shopify, GitHub, Gusto, Zendesk, Instacart, Procore, Doximity,
      Coinbase, and others claim billion-dollar valuations from work done with Rails. It&amp;#39;s beyond satisfying to see this
      much value created with a web framework I&amp;#39;ve spent the last two decades evolving and maintaining. A beautiful prize
      from a life&amp;#39;s work realized.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it&amp;#39;s also possible to look at this through
      another lens, and see a huge missed opportunity! If hundreds of billions of dollars in valuations came to be from tools that
      I originated, why am I not at least a pétit billionaire?! What missteps along the way must I have made to deserve life as
      merely a rich software entrepreneur, with so few direct, personal receipts from the work on
      Rails?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This line of thinking is lethal to the open source
      spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The moment you go down the path of gratitude grievances, you&amp;#39;ll
      see ungrateful ghosts everywhere. People who owe you something, if they succeed. A ratio that&amp;#39;s never quite right
      between what you&amp;#39;ve helped create and what you&amp;#39;ve managed to capture. If you let it, it&amp;#39;ll haunt you
      forever.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;So don&amp;#39;t! Don&amp;#39;t let the success of others diminish your
      satisfaction with your own efforts. Unless you&amp;#39;re literally Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, or Jeff Bezos,
      there&amp;#39;ll always be someone richer than you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The rewards I withdraw from
      open source flow from all the happy programmers who&amp;#39;ve been able to write Ruby to build these amazingly successful
      web businesses with Rails. That enjoyment only grows the more successful these business are! The more economic activity
      stems from Rails, the more programmers will be able to find work where they might write
      Ruby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;d feel different if I was a starving open source artist
      holed up somewhere begrudging the wheels of capitalism. But fate has been more than kind enough to me in that regard. I want
      for very little, because I&amp;#39;ve been blessed sufficiently. That&amp;#39;s a special kind of wealth:
      Enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And that&amp;#39;s also the open source spirit: To let a billion lemons go
      unsqueezed. To capture vanishingly less than you create. To marvel at a vast commons of software, offered with no strings
      attached, to any who might wish to build.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thou shall not lust after thy open source&amp;#39;s users and
      their success.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>To the crazy ones</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;In an earlier era, we&amp;#39;d all have been glued to the television to cheer &lt;a
      href="https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1845442658397049011"&gt;SpaceX successfully catching Starship&amp;#39;s returning booster
      rocket&lt;/a&gt; on the first try. I remember my father talking about seeing Apollo 11 make it to the moon. That was a
      lifelong memory for him. And I remember, as a six-year old boy, watching the fatal Challenger explosion on TV.
      That&amp;#39;s been a lifelong memory for me. Reaching for space, in triumph or tragedy, ought to be special.
      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But today it&amp;#39;s often just another post that quickly scrolls by on your
      feed. Maybe you pause for a minute, but the moment easily gets compressed to the same level of gravitas as someone getting
      punched in the face or an extra cute cat. The spectacle has been completely commoditized. The grand gesture is gone. It now
      takes effort to actually marvel when something truly spectacular occurs. Like shooting the Starship, 50 feet taller than the
      Statue of Liberty, towards space, and seeing it stick the landing to perfection.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;You should
      make that effort. Embrace that marvel. Don&amp;#39;t be cynical. Don&amp;#39;t let transient party politics cloud the
      moment. Musk was once considered to be on the blue team, now he&amp;#39;s on the red team. Little of that will matter in the
      long term. But propelling progress forward definitely will.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And speaking of Mr Musk, what an
      insane week for him, and for everyone excited about progress. &lt;a
      href="https://x.com/Tesla/status/1844583703604772893"&gt;Cybertaxis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
      href="https://x.com/Tesla/status/1843922599765590148"&gt;robot bartenders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
      href="https://x.com/Tesla/status/1844584591408910512"&gt;art-deco people carriers&lt;/a&gt;, and now returning starships.
      This is exactly the kind of willing the future into existence that leaps of progress depend on. Who cares whether all these
      incredible ambitions arrive right on time or not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because ambition this crazy is only likely
      to emerge from someone equally and sufficiently nuts. And I mean that in the most admirable way possible. Musk is nuts.
      He&amp;#39;s one of the crazy ones. A true original. Easy to hate, impossible to ignore.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And
      that&amp;#39;s what gets me. Everyone find it easy to nod in agreement with &lt;a
      href="https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/heres-to-the-crazy-ones"&gt;Jobs&amp;#39; ode to To The Crazy Ones&lt;/a&gt;.
      Everyone wants to believe that they&amp;#39;d support &amp;quot;the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers&amp;quot;. That
      they too would cheer for those who are &amp;quot;not fond of rules. And... have no respect for the status
      quo&amp;quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But they won&amp;#39;t and they don&amp;#39;t. Most people are either &lt;a
      href="https://paulgraham.com/conformism.html"&gt;aggressively or passively conformist&lt;/a&gt;. They squirm when The Crazy
      Ones actually attempt to change the world. They don&amp;#39;t see genius as often as they see transgressors. A failure to
      comply and comport. And they don&amp;#39;t like it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I like it. Not crazy for the
      sake of crazy, but crazy for the sake of progress. Demonstrable, undeniable, awe-inspiring progress. And that&amp;#39;s what
      Mr Musk has brought us and continues to bring us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To infinity and beyond, you crazy spaceman!
      🫡&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Open source royalty and mad kings</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;I&amp;#39;m solidly in favor of the &lt;a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life"&gt;Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) model&lt;/a&gt; of
      open source stewardship. This is how projects from Linux to Python, from Laravel to Ruby, and yes, Rails, have kept their
      cohesion, decisiveness, and forward motion. It&amp;#39;s a model with decades worth of achievements to its name. But
      it&amp;#39;s not a mandate from heaven. It&amp;#39;s not infallible.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I am loathe to even
      open this discussion. Because I&amp;#39;ve weathered more than &lt;a
      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/no-railsconf-faa7935e"&gt;my fair share&lt;/a&gt; of bad-faith attempts on my own
      stewardship, and witnessed the show trials of several others. It doesn&amp;#39;t take much for contentious issues within a
      project, or societal moral panics outside it, to seed dethroning mobs. Which will hijack then eulogize &lt;em&gt;The Will of
      The Community&lt;/em&gt;, as though &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; somehow deserved the mandate from
      heaven.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half the advantage of the BDFL model is exactly in allowing for unpopular decisions
      to be made without the lethargic mores of committees and bureaucracy! &lt;a
      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/open-source-is-neither-a-community-nor-a-democracy-606abdab"&gt;Open source is not a
      democracy&lt;/a&gt;, and we all benefit from that fact, whether we accept it or not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what
      follows is not a categorical argument. I believe in the social utility of an open source royalty. One crowned on the virtues
      of initiative, perseverance, contributions, and technical excellence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Matt
      Mullenweg has earned his crown in the land of WordPress. He created the system, and for twenty years has been its prime
      champion and cheerleader. His achievements are obvious. Half the damn internet runs on WordPress! There&amp;#39;s an
      industry worth billions feeding theme designers, plugin makers, hosting companies, and Matt&amp;#39;s own Automattic
      enterprise. It&amp;#39;s a first-rate open source success story.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it&amp;#39;s also one
      that has taken a dark turn since &lt;a
      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/automattic-is-doing-open-source-dirty-b95cf128"&gt;Automattic went to war with WP Engine
      (WPE)&lt;/a&gt; over a claim that the latter pay 8% of its revenues as a tithe approximate under the guise of
      &amp;quot;giving back more&amp;quot;. The leverage of extraction started as a spurious trademark claim, but has since
      escalated into &lt;a
      href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/24/10/03/1354214/wp-engine-sues-wordpress-for-libel-extortion"&gt;what WPE has alleged
      as extortion&lt;/a&gt;, and what I see as a seemingly never-ending series of dramatic overreaches and breaches of open
      source norms. Especially the introduction of &lt;a
      href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-login-gets-mandatory-affiliation-checkbox-following-wp-engine-dispute"&gt;the login
      loyalty oath&lt;/a&gt;, and now with &lt;a href="https://x.com/wp_acf/status/1845169499064107049"&gt;the expropriation of
      WPE&amp;#39;s Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s a lot, so
      let&amp;#39;s start from the end. The most recent escalation, and, in my opinion, the most unhinged, is the expropriation of
      the ACF plugin. Automattic first answered WPE&amp;#39;s lawsuit by blocking engineers from the latter from accessing the
      WordPress.org plugin registry, which is used to distribute updates and security patches. It then used the fact that WPE no
      longer had access to the registry to expropriate the plugin, including reviews and download stats!! &lt;a
      href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/"&gt;The ACF entry now points to Automattic&amp;#39;s own Secure
      Custom Fields&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a dispute that started with a claim of &amp;quot;trademark
      confusion&amp;quot;, there&amp;#39;s an incredible irony in the fact that Automattic is now hijacking users looking for ACF
      onto their own plugin. And providing as rational for this unprecedented breach of open source norms that ACF needs
      maintenance, and since WPE is no longer able to provide that (given that they were blocked!), Automattic has to step in to
      do so. I mean, what?!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine this happening on npm? Imagine Meta getting into a legal
      dispute with Microsoft (the owners of GitHub, who in turn own npm), and Microsoft responding by directing GitHub to ban all
      Meta employees from accessing their repositories. And then Microsoft just takes over the official React repository, pointing
      it to their own Super React fork. This is the kind of crazy we&amp;#39;re talking
      about.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weaponizing open source code registries is something we simply cannot allow to form
      precedence. They must remain neutral territory. Little Switzerlands in a world of constant commercial
      skirmishes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that&amp;#39;s really the main reason I care to comment on this whole sordid
      ordeal. If this fight was just one between two billion-dollar companies, as Automattic and WPE both are, I would not have
      cared to wade in. But the principles at stake extend far beyond the two of
      them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Using an open source project like WordPress as leverage in this contract
      dispute, and weaponizing its plugin registry, is an endangerment of an open source peace that has reigned decades, with
      peace-time dividends for all. Not since &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO%E2%80%93Linux_disputes"&gt;the
      SCO-Linux nonsense&lt;/a&gt; of the early 2000s have we faced such a potential explosion in fear, doubt, and uncertainty in
      the open source realm on basic matters everyone thought they could take for
      granted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So while I always try to keep things from getting personal, I&amp;#39;ll
      break practice to make this plea: Matt, don&amp;#39;t turn into a mad king. I hold your work on WordPress and beyond in the
      highest esteem. And I recognize the temptation of gratitude grievances, arising from beneficiaries getting more from our
      work than they return in contributions. But that must remain a moral critique, not a commercial crusade. You can&amp;#39;t
      just extract by force that which you believe to be owed beyond the license agreement on a
      whim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t make me cheer for a private-equity operator like Silver
      Lake, Matt. Don&amp;#39;t make me wish for them to file an emergency injunction to stop the expropriation of
      ACF.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&amp;#39;s not too late. Yes, some bridges have been burned, but look at
      those as sunk cost. Even in isolation, the additional expense from here on out to continue this conquest is not going to be
      worth it either. There&amp;#39;s still time to turn around. To strike a modest deal where all parties save some face. I
      implore you to pursue it.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Automattic is doing open source dirty</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;&lt;a
      href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/05/wordpress-ceo-matt-mullenweg-goes-nuclear-on-silver-lake-wp-engine-.html"&gt;Automattic
      demanding 8% of WP Engine&amp;#39;s revenues&lt;/a&gt; because they&amp;#39;re not &amp;quot;giving back enough&amp;quot; to
      WordPress is a wanton violation of general open source ideals and the specifics of &lt;a
      href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html"&gt;the GPL license&lt;/a&gt;. Automattic is completely out
      of line, and the potential damage to the open source world extends far beyond the WordPress. Don&amp;#39;t let &lt;a
      href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/159-employees-are-leaving-automattic-as-ceos-fight-with-wp-engine-escalates/"&gt;the
      drama&lt;/a&gt; or its characters distract you from that threat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A key part of why
      open source has been so successful over the last several decades is the clarity and certainty of its licensing regime. Which
      allow you to build a business on open source without fear of frivolous claims or surprise shakedowns. The terms of the deal
      are spelled out in the license agreement, and the common ones, like MIT, BSD, or GPL, have all stood the test of
      time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most important part of such a license is usually the fact that the software is
      offered without any warranty. But some also include provisions that require any modifications to be released as open source
      as well. None of the major licenses, however, say anything close to &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s free but only until the project
      owners deem you too successful and then you&amp;#39;ll have to pay 8% of your revenues to support the project&amp;quot;.
      That&amp;#39;s a completely bonkers and arbitrary standard based in the rule of spite, not
      law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even have a dog in this fight, only a set of principles. If
      anything, I&amp;#39;d be naturally inclined to be on Team WordPress. Between creating one of the most widely used
      open-source programs and powering half the internet, there&amp;#39;s every tribal reason to side with Automattic over WP
      Engine&amp;#39;s private-equity owners at Silver Lake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But whatever my feelings
      about private equity in general or Silver Lake&amp;#39;s management of WP Engine in particular, I care far more about the
      integrity of open source licenses, and that integrity is under direct assault by Automattic&amp;#39;s grotesque claim for WP
      Engine&amp;#39;s revenues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&amp;#39;s even more outrageous that Automattic has
      chosen trademarks as their method to &lt;a
      href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/10/04/1925239/matt-mullenweg-wordpressorg-just-belongs-to-me"&gt;get their
      &amp;quot;Al Capone&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; when up until 2018 they were part owners of WP Engine before selling their stake to
      Silver Lake!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And yet, I can see where this is coming from. &lt;a
      href="https://rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;, the open-source web framework I created, has been used to create
      businesses worth hundreds of billions of dollars combined. Some of those businesses express their gratitude and
      self-interest by supporting the framework with dedicated developers, membership of &lt;a
      href="https://rubyonrails.org/foundation"&gt;The Rails Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, or conference sponsorships. But many also do
      not! And that is absolutely their right, even if it occasionally irks a
      little.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That&amp;#39;s the deal. That&amp;#39;s open source. I give you &lt;a
      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-open-source-gift-exchange-2171e0f0"&gt;a gift of code&lt;/a&gt;, you accept the terms of
      the license. There cannot be a second set of shadow obligations that might suddenly apply, if you strike it rich using the
      software. Then the license is meaningless, the clarity all muddled, and certainty
      lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Look, Automattic can change their license away from the GPL any time they
      wish. The new license will only apply to new code, though, and WP Engine, or anyone else, are eligible to fork the project.
      That&amp;#39;s what happened with Redis after Redis Labs dropped their BSD license and went with a commercial
      source-available alternative. &lt;a href="https://valkey.io/"&gt;Valkey&lt;/a&gt; was forked from the last free Redis
      version, and now that&amp;#39;s where anyone interested in an open-source Redis implementation is likely to
      go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But I suspect Automattic wants to have their cake and eat it too. They want to
      retain WordPress&amp;#39; shine of open source, but also be able to extract their pound of flesh from any competitor that
      might appear, whenever they see fit. Screw that.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Kamal 2: Thou need not PaaS</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://kamal-deploy.org/"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; was our ticket out of the cloud. A simple tool for
      deploying containerized applications onto our own hardware, without the need for the complexity of something like
      Kubernetes. &lt;a href="https://dev.37signals.com/kamal-2/"&gt;Kamal 2&lt;/a&gt; is a huge leap forward for that tool, and
      it has just shipped. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now you can deploy multiple applications to the same server, and you
      can have SSL certificates automatically provisioned via Let&amp;#39;s Encrypt. A big compression in complexity, especially
      when just getting started.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because Kamal isn&amp;#39;t just for high-end cloud exits where
      applications rely on an entire fleet of machines. It&amp;#39;s also an excellent option for running a bunch of smaller apps
      on a single server. Imagine just how you can run on &lt;a
      href="https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ax162-r/configurator/#/"&gt;one of those amazing Hetzner EPYC 9454
      boxes&lt;/a&gt; with 96 threads and 256GB of RAM that they sell for $220/month! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a
      href="https://basecamp.com/cloud-exit"&gt;Our move out of the cloud&lt;/a&gt; would not has been nearly as smooth or as fast
      without Kamal. And I&amp;#39;m thrilled we can share such a tool with everyone else who might want to reconsider the cost of
      Platform-as-a-Service setups. Kamal works great whether you&amp;#39;re starting on a cheap $5 VPS, moving onto a fleet of
      cloud VMs, using dedicated-but-managed servers, or running your own hardware entirely.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;In
      fact, it&amp;#39;s chief mission is to allow you to move through all those stages of a production deployment without onerous
      migration costs or delays. We can&amp;#39;t have competition in the cloud as long as folks are locked into proprietary or
      overly-complicated setups that makes moving from one vendor to another a huge hassle and
      expense.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this sounds at all appetizing, &lt;a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4b2teG_hc"&gt;checkout the new Kamal 2 demo&lt;/a&gt;, which shows how to deploy a
      simple Go application (Kamal isn&amp;#39;t just for Rails!), how to add another Rails app on the same box, and how to move
      that Rails app onto a three-machine Hetzner cloud setup. All in under half an hour.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enjoy
      Kamal 2!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;figure class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--webp"&gt;

    <title>Wonderful Rails World Vibes</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;I totally understand how programming conferences end up being held in a drab Sheraton hotel somewhere to save
      money. It&amp;#39;s expensive to outfit a cool venue with the gear and operations needed to pull off a great experience for
      speakers, sponsors, and attendees. And while the cost of doing something more inspiring than a carpet-clad conference hotel
      is clear, the pay off is often fuzzy until you do. But &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzsRWH0n6O4"&gt;Rails
      World 2024&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto just made that value crystal clear. Holy smackeroli, what an incredible
      show!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="attachment-gallery attachment-gallery--4"&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We had over a thousand people gathered from 57 countries in one of the coolest conference venues
      I&amp;#39;ve ever had the pleasure of talking to programmers in. Amanda Perino, the executive director of the Rails
      Foundation, and the mastermind behind Rails World, gambled on an inside/outside venue in Toronto in September, and it paid
      off big. Talking Rails between the trees, in the open air, and basking in the sun made for a unique and mesmerizing couple
      of days in Canada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="attachment-gallery attachment-gallery--2"&gt;

      webpacker and whatnot, Rails has found a new stride and a new confidence to pursue its counter melody to the rest of the
      industry. While everyone seems resigned to slice the expertise of web development into ever thinner specialties, Rails is
      doubling down on the one-developer framework, the full stack, and the compression of
      complexity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="attachment-gallery attachment-gallery--2"&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And while venture capitalists are moving in on developer tech from all sides, Rails is reaffirming
      its commitment to open source generics, and deployment strategies that don&amp;#39;t require paying big premiums for
      wrappers around AWS. (You should never need a PaaS subscription to go live with
      Rails!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But while both of those ingredients, a fantastic venue and a stacked
      shipping schedule, helped set us up for a good time, the fact that THE VIBES have so definitively turned around in the Rails
      ecosystem, as well as the rest of the programming world, certainly contributed too. We&amp;#39;ve now long since put those
      awkward first years of the decade behind us, and we&amp;#39;re just back to having a great time celebrating competency and
      conceptual compression together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And what a celebration! While I really enjoyed
      delivering &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cEn_83zRFw"&gt;the opening keynote&lt;/a&gt;, it was the session
      with Tobi and Matz that truly warmed my heart. I haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to really talk with Matz for many years, to
      truly thank him for the incredible gift of Ruby that he just keeps delivering to us. So to do so in a session moderated by
      Tobi was beyond special. So too was offering Matz the Rails Lifetime Award, which apparently was the first award Matz has
      ever received himself. Just look at this:&lt;br&gt; &lt;figure class="attachment attachment--preview

      all feel incredibly welcome on Shopify&amp;#39;s home turf of Toronto. From the pre-game event, to the support for the
      conference, to the insane after party. Shopify&amp;#39;s patronage towards Ruby and Rails is the stuff of a living legend,
      and the results, from their superb work on YJIT, to their strong presence on Rails Core, to their support of the Rails
      Foundation and Rails World. We couldn&amp;#39;t have asked for a better host or

      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now I know all of this sounds a bit sappy at this point. Thanks
      going here, thanks going there, but that really is the key sentiment that I left Toronto with. Just an immense gratitude
      towards all the companies, contributors, and individuals working together in the Rails ecosystem for a better tomorrow. The
      web does not have to be as complicated as we&amp;#39;ve let it become, and here&amp;#39;s a corner of the programming world
      pushing back in unison.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean, I&amp;#39;ve been working on &lt;a
      href="https://x.com/dhh/status/1840499307579072514"&gt;The Web Problem&lt;/a&gt; with Ruby through Rails for well over
      twenty years now, but I&amp;#39;m as fired up as ever to push the frontier forward. And it&amp;#39;s largely because the
      effort is sustained by such a broad and charitable ecosystem.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Rails World such a
      roaring success -- I mean it &lt;a href="https://x.com/dhh/status/1785368652440916121"&gt;sold out in a mere twenty
      minutes&lt;/a&gt; and still managed to surpass the hype!! -- it might look obvious in retrospect that it was always going to
      be like this. But it wasn&amp;#39;t obvious at all at the outset. It took a real leap of faith from &lt;a
      href="https://cookpad.com/"&gt;Cookpad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.doximity.com/"&gt;Doximity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
      href="https://www.fleetio.com/"&gt;Fleetio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
      href="https://www.intercom.com/"&gt;Intercom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.procore.com/"&gt;Procore&lt;/a&gt;, and
      &lt;a href="https://www.shopify.com/"&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt; to join with &lt;a
      href="https://37signals.com/"&gt;37signals&lt;/a&gt; in creating &lt;a href="https://rubyonrails.org/foundation"&gt;The
      Rails Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, without which none of this would have happened.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that we
      were able to put on this incredible celebration of Rails in Toronto at a very affordable entry price relied not just on the
      support of sponsors like &lt;a href="https://shopify.com"&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
      href="https://github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.appsignal.com/"&gt;AppSignal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
      href="https://www.clio.com/"&gt;Clio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.huntress.com/"&gt;Huntress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a

      &lt;a href="https://frame.work/"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://rubyonrails.org/world/2024"&gt;and
      others&lt;/a&gt;, but also on the fact that the Rails Foundation, the founding core members listed above, as well as the
      contributing members (AppSignal, &lt;a href="https://www.bigbinary.com/"&gt;BigBinary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
      href="https://www.cedarcode.com/"&gt;cedarcode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://makandra.de/en"&gt;makandra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a

      &lt;a href="https://www.tablecheck.com/"&gt;TableCheck&lt;/a&gt;), were willing to happily underwrite a loss of over
      $100,000 on the conference itself.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because the mission for The Rails Foundation is to
      broaden the appeal of Rails, excite existing and new programmers in our ecosystem, and help educate them all on the latest
      advances with the framework. That&amp;#39;s what the budget is for, and spending a considerable chunk of it on subsidizing
      Rails World serves that mission in full.&lt;br&gt; &lt;figure class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable

      know there was enough FOMO to float a blimp online from those who didn&amp;#39;t manage to snatch a ticket in those
      ludicrously short twenty minutes it took before the conference sold out, but at least all the keynotes and sessions are made
      available as quickly as we can edit and upload them. You won&amp;#39;t be getting the vibes of the hallway track, but maybe
      you&amp;#39;ll have a chance to remedy that next year, when Rails World returns to Amsterdam for the 2025
      show!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the mean time, just one last thank you to everyone who attended, brought their good
      vibes, and helped ensure that we can all feel energized and inspired about Ruby on Rails for another year and beyond! ✌️❤️

    <title>Ears rarely open until a rapport is established</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to open cold with a controversial take to a bunch of strangers. And the room is always cold on
      X or in a one-off blog post. Just like comedy, half the battle of winning over the audience comes from a solid introduction,
      good timing, and a broad smile to warm the room. You can have great material, but if the vibe is off, good luck landing a
      laugh.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTa2d3OLXhg"&gt;The stream I did on
      Monday&lt;/a&gt; with ThePrimeagen and TJ DeVries illustrates this to a T. Not only was the stream warm and in a good mood
      from spending time with ThePrimeagen first (who wouldn&amp;#39;t be!), but the pair immediately elevated that spirit further
      by being such welcoming and gracious hosts. Thereby signaling to their audience that who they were about to hear would be
      worth listening to with an open mind.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s the kind of introduction that makes all
      the difference as to whether someone is willing to grant you the grace of charitable listening -- or whether they&amp;#39;ll
      immediately set their defenses to Max Stranger Skepticism.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been making many of
      my main arguments for years. Some for decades, even. And I know that many in that stream had probably heard some of them
      before, and dismissed them out of hand, because we hadn&amp;#39;t established a rapport that would warrant an open mind.
      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That&amp;#39;s where writing just can&amp;#39;t compete with a podcast or a
      stream. Putting a face, a voice, and a vibe to the argument absolutely changes its tone, and in turn, the emotions it
      evokes. And that&amp;#39;s what most people go off on. Those emotions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I sometimes do
      struggle with that. Thinking that the strength of an argument should be gauged purely by its logic or at least its rhetoric.
      But I&amp;#39;ve really come to appreciate the value of set and setting. Of a warm introduction. Of establishing a
      rapport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We might not all become friends on the internet, but we needn&amp;#39;t
      be strangers either. And the best way to move on from being strangers is by having others vouch for your earnestness. Thanks
      for doing that, ThePrimeagen and TJ DeVries ✌️&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Wonderful vi</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;The speed of change in technology often appears to be the industry&amp;#39;s defining characteristic. Nothing
      highlights that perception more than the recent and relentless march of AI advancements. But for as much as some things in
      technology change, many other things stay the same. Like vi!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;vi is a programming text editor
      that was created by Bill Joy before computers even had real graphical interfaces, &lt;a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi_(text_editor)"&gt;back in 1976&lt;/a&gt;. Just five years after the first
      microprocessor, the Intel 4004. In computing terms, we might as well be talking about ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs here.
      It&amp;#39;s that old.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it&amp;#39;s fundamental design, splitting insert mode from
      command mode, remains unchanged in its modern successors, like &lt;a href="https://www.vim.org/"&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
      href="https://neovim.io/"&gt;Neovim&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the entire vi ethos of maximizing programmer productivity by
      minimizing keystrokes has carried forward all these years with remarkably little distortion. In 1976, most computers
      didn&amp;#39;t even have a mouse. In 2024, most vi-successor users don&amp;#39;t even need one when programming.
      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s kinda incredible! That I can sit here, almost half a century after Bill Joy
      first gave birth to vi, and enjoy the same quirky style of text editing to make modern web apps in 2024. It&amp;#39;s not
      &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I use Neovim, but it sure does make it feel extra special.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The
      other reason it feels special is that vi makes turns manipulating text into a key-based form of Street Fighter. Sure, you
      can have fun just learning the basic buttons for punching and kicking, but the game unlocks an entirely new dimension the
      moment you pull off &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ihrSG0j6l0"&gt;your first hadoken&lt;/a&gt; — a fireball
      move done by making a half circle with the joystick followed by a punch. And now you&amp;#39;re off to learn all the special
      moves followed by techniques for stringing them together into
      combos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That&amp;#39;s what pulling a &amp;quot;ciq&amp;quot; in Neovim feels
      like. It stands for &amp;quot;Change Inside Quotes&amp;quot;. So say you&amp;#39;re in the middle of a line of code like
      this: &amp;quot;puts &amp;#39;Hello&amp;lt;cursor&amp;gt; World&amp;#39;&amp;quot;. With that cursor placed after the
      &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;ciq&amp;quot; move will select all the text inside the quotes (&amp;quot;Hello
      World&amp;quot;), remove it, and place your cursor right after the opening quotes, ready to write something new.
      That&amp;#39;s pretty magic!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it just goes on and on from there. You can use
      &amp;quot;dab&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Delete Around Brackets&amp;quot;, which is great when you want to remove all the
      parameters used for a method at the end of a line in Ruby. Or what about &amp;quot;vii&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;(Visually)
      Select Inside [the current level of] Indention&amp;quot;, so you have the entire body of a method highlighted, ready for
      overwriting with a paste or copying or cutting. Or just &amp;quot;yiw&amp;quot; which copies the current word your cursor is
      on, regardless of where in the word it is, and copies it to the clipboard.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#39;s
      an astounding number of combos like these available in Neovim (and the other vi flavors). But now you&amp;#39;re probably
      thinking: how could anyone possibly remember all that? Which brings me to the real wonder of vi: It&amp;#39;s not just an
      editor, it&amp;#39;s a &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; for editing. Once you learn the basic grammar of vi text manipulation,
      and you learn a few actions, scopes, and objects, you can string it all together in any combination
      possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the structure: [Action] [Scope] [Object]. I&amp;#39;ve
      already given you four actions in the examples above: change, select, delete, and copy. And there are only two primary
      scopes: inside and around. And we&amp;#39;ve looked at four different objects: quotes, brackets, indention, and word.
      There&amp;#39;s your language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;yaq = Copy (yank) Around Quotes&lt;br&gt;diw =
      Delete Inside Word&lt;br&gt;vab = Select (visually) Around Brackets&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;See how it&amp;#39;s
      starting to make sense? Now let&amp;#39;s add one more move to the combo, which is a count. So you can also
      do:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;3cw = Change Three Words
      4dd = Delete Four Lines
      10j = Jump Ten Lines&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There&amp;#39;s more to learning the vi command
      mode than just this, but to me, this is where the magic is. The language of text manipulation. The action-scope-object
      grammar. It&amp;#39;s when that clicks that the combo stringing begins, and your dopamine starts
      flowing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#39;s just uniquely satisfying to string a handful of these combos together
      and see the text beneath you radically manipulated. In a way you just know would have been a drag to do in any other editor.
      That&amp;#39;s the game-like joy of vi&amp;#39;s power moves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now all of this still comes
      with quite some learning curve, of course. On top of the text manipulation, there&amp;#39;s a bunch of &lt;a
      href="https://manual.omakub.org/1/read/13/neovim"&gt;basic navigation keystrokes&lt;/a&gt; to learn, but I think you ought
      to start with the basic grammar explained above. That&amp;#39;s the fun bit, that&amp;#39;s the addictive
      bit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if this appetizer has you hungry for more, I&amp;#39;d start by installing Neovim
      using &lt;a href="https://www.lazyvim.org/"&gt;the superb LazyVim distribution&lt;/a&gt;. Neovim from scratch is like
      climbing Mount Everest without oxygen. If all you&amp;#39;re interested in at first is a peek at the view, book that LazyVim
      helicopter tour before bothering the sherpas. Then checkout the excellent Vim and Neovim tutorials available on Youtube from
      the likes of &lt;a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6AR2RMB5tE&amp;amp;list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R"&gt;ThePrimeagan&lt;/a&gt;
      and &lt;a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHTeCSVAFNY&amp;amp;list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn"&gt;Typecraft&lt;/a&gt;,
      along with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N93cTbtLCIM"&gt;Elijah Manor&amp;#39;s LazyVim
      introduction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You can run Neovim on any operating system, but it works
      better if you&amp;#39;re using a modern, fast terminal like &lt;a href="https://alacritty.org/"&gt;Alacritty&lt;/a&gt; or
      Kitty. I personally use Alacritty and Neovim together with the multi-pane terminal enhancement &lt;a
      href="https://zellij.dev/"&gt;Zellij&lt;/a&gt;. The entire package is configured out of the box in &lt;a
      href="https://omakub.org/"&gt;Omakub&lt;/a&gt;, if your adventurous spirit should extend to a trip into Linux. But you
      absolutely don&amp;#39;t need to run Linux to enjoy Neovim. It&amp;#39;s great on both Mac and Windows
      too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So that&amp;#39;s it. That&amp;#39;s my testimony to what a wonderful
      experience it&amp;#39;s been adopting Neovim. It certainly wasn&amp;#39;t without some frustration (like figuring out how to
      do my own snippets!!), and it&amp;#39;s not without some sadness that I&amp;#39;ve given up on my beloved TextMate editor,
      but I can comfortably say, &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/finding-the-last-editor-dae701cc"&gt;after running this
      stack since February&lt;/a&gt;, that it feels like home now. A combo-smashing, hadoken-wielding home. And it&amp;#39;s
      awesome.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;May vi reign for another fifty years and beyond!&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Back in the market (Sonos Edition)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been a Sonos megafan for years. Owned probably two dozen devices for different homes. Mainly amps
      for in-ceiling speakers, but also some Ones, 3s, 5s. All of it. Because it Just Worked when it came to multi-room music. Now
      it doesn&amp;#39;t, and it hasn&amp;#39;t for a long time, so I&amp;#39;ve been back in the
      market.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure what the problem is. The new app has &lt;a
      href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/why-is-the-sonos-app-so-broken-140028060.html"&gt;gotten a lot of the
      blame&lt;/a&gt; for Sonos&amp;#39; problems, but to me, the bigger issue has been how unreliable the system at large has
      become. And that doesn&amp;#39;t seem like it&amp;#39;s just an app issue. Probably more of a firmware problem. But whatever
      it is, it&amp;#39;s been driving me crazy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you want to listen to some music at dinner, you want play
      to mean PLAY RIGHT NOW. Not &amp;quot;won&amp;#39;t connect&amp;quot;. Not &amp;quot;try restarting the app&amp;quot;. Just
      play. But Sonos hasn&amp;#39;t been like that. It&amp;#39;s been an exercise in frustration instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I
      sympathize with their situation, though. &lt;a
      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/software-has-bugs-this-is-normal-26d5fd06"&gt;Software is hard!&lt;/a&gt; Especially when
      you&amp;#39;ve been around as long as Sonos has, and have a back catalog of a million different devices, as well as a road
      map with tons of new stuff coming out. It can&amp;#39;t be easy to juggle all that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second thing
      that&amp;#39;s clearly hard is wireless synchronization. Sonos has a huge patent portfolio for making sure the music is
      always in sync across multiple rooms and devices, even when it&amp;#39;s running over a wireless connection. &lt;a
      href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/google-loses-sonos-patent-case-starts-stripping-functionality-from-speakers/"&gt;Google
      lost in court&lt;/a&gt; when they tried to steal that tech. It&amp;#39;s a formidable fortress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I
      don&amp;#39;t need wireless. All my gear is hardwired with ethernet. And that&amp;#39;s why the problems I&amp;#39;ve had
      have been extra infuriating. When the music drops out. Or it won&amp;#39;t start. Or you can&amp;#39;t connect to the
      devices. That just shouldn&amp;#39;t happen when it&amp;#39;s on a hardwired connection, but it does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And
      it&amp;#39;s not like we haven&amp;#39;t tried to figure this out. It&amp;#39;s literally been months of debugging. The AV
      outfit I&amp;#39;m using has been working with Sonos support. They&amp;#39;ve been replacing Amps with newer hardware. Lots
      of experimentation. But nothing has made the system reliable or enjoyable to use. Certainly not through the Sonos
      app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So last week I finally threw in the towel and got back into the market. Turns out there are quite a
      few competitors out there now. I decided to try two: &lt;a
      href="https://www.bluesound.com/products/powernode-edge/"&gt;Bluesound&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
      href="https://www.wiimhome.com/wiimamp/overview"&gt;WiiM&lt;/a&gt;. They offer a comparable streaming amp that I can hook up
      to my in-ceiling Klipsch speakers, and they both connect via ethernet, and they both support &lt;a
      href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-connect/"&gt;Spotify Connect&lt;/a&gt;. WiiM in particular has been
      &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyGSWFYFuqk"&gt;wowing hifi aficionados&lt;/a&gt; with their incredible
      price/performance ratio. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instantly it was revelation. Music to either amp would start
      &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; when I selected a song in Spotify. I&amp;#39;d been boiled by the Sonos problems for so
      long that I didn&amp;#39;t even remember what &lt;em&gt;instant&lt;/em&gt; does for enjoyment. It does a
      lot!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now that I&amp;#39;ve been pushed back into the market, I&amp;#39;ve realized that the historic
      Sonos app advantage just doesn&amp;#39;t matter nearly as much as it used to. The Spotify app is a superior way to browse
      music, and both WiiM and Bluesound make it easy to group speakers. In the past, those two points served as the Sonos moat.
      That&amp;#39;s over, it seems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Further more, the WiiM Amp is just $299! That&amp;#39;s half the price of
      the Sonos Amp (and the Bluesound). And for the kind of in-ceiling, background music I&amp;#39;m using it for, it&amp;#39;s
      more than plenty. And despite the low price, the software is actually the best of all three options. It&amp;#39;s incredibly
      easy and quick to set up. You&amp;#39;re playing music five minutes after you&amp;#39;ve unpacked the
      device.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;m telling you all of this because there are a lot of lessons for business owners of all
      types in this Sonos predicament. Like, if you&amp;#39;ve managed to win over a customer, the last thing you want to do is
      get them back into the market to sample the competition. If you can keep them content with what they got, they
      aren&amp;#39;t interested in whatever anyone else is offering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s worth
      going the extra effort not to fuck with existing customers. &lt;a
      href="https://businessofsoftware.org/2015/10/david-heinemeier-hansson-rewrite-basecamp-business-of-software-conference-video-dhh-bos2015/"&gt;That&amp;#39;s
      why we run three different versions of Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;. Including one that hasn&amp;#39;t seen any feature updates for 14
      years! A version that still has thousands of happy customers generating millions in revenue every year. They signed up for a
      system they liked in the mid-to-late 2000s, and they&amp;#39;re not in the market for a change. THAT&amp;#39;S JUST FINE BY
      US!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, it isn&amp;#39;t free to do this. But Sonos eventually got it right the &lt;a
      href="https://www.gearbrain.com/old-sono-stop-software-updates-2644889020.html"&gt;last time they faced this
      dilemma&lt;/a&gt;. When they wanted to push the last new Sonos app, and couldn&amp;#39;t make their plans work with the old
      hardware. The first approach would have essentially bricked them all. But they came around, split the apps, and I still use
      the Sonos S1 setup with an installation that&amp;#39;s over a decade old.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I&amp;#39;m sure
      we&amp;#39;ve gotten it wrong at &lt;a href="https://37signals.com/"&gt;37signals&lt;/a&gt; many times over the years too.
      Accidentally changed something that we thought would be better, or at least more attractive to new customers, and ended up
      pushing happy buyers back into the market. Some of that is unavoidable, but a lot of it is not. A lot of it is a
      choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&amp;#39;t make that choice. Don&amp;#39;t push customers back into the market. They might
      just find that Spotify Connect is pretty awesome, and that amps half the price can do the job. Keep current customers happy,
      then go chasing new ones.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Passwords have problems, but passkeys have more</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;We had originally planned to go all-in on passkeys for &lt;a
      href="https://once.com/campfire"&gt;ONCE/Campfire&lt;/a&gt;, and we built the early authentication system entirely around
      that. It was not a simple setup! Handling passkeys properly is surprisingly complicated on the backend, but we got it done.
      Unfortunately, the user experience kinda sucked, so we ended up ripping it all out
      again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The problem with passkeys is that they&amp;#39;re essentially a halfway
      house to a password manager, but tied to a specific platform in ways that aren&amp;#39;t obvious to a user at all, and
      liable to easily leave them unable to access of their accounts. Much the same way that two-factor authentication can do, but
      worse, since you&amp;#39;re not even aware of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take a simple
      example. You have an iPhone and a Windows computer. Chrome on Windows stores your passkeys in Windows Hello, so if you sign
      up for a service on Windows, and you then want to access it on iPhone, you&amp;#39;re going to be stuck (unless
      you&amp;#39;re so forward thinking as to add a second passkey, somehow, from the iPhone will on the Windows computer!). The
      passkey lives on the wrong device, if you&amp;#39;re away from the computer and want to login, and it&amp;#39;s not at all
      obvious to most users how they might fix that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even in the best case scenario, where
      you&amp;#39;re using an iPhone and a Mac that are synced with Keychain Access via iCloud, you&amp;#39;re still going to be
      stuck, if you need to access a service on a friend&amp;#39;s computer in a pinch. Or if you&amp;#39;re not using Keychain
      Access at all. There are plenty of pitfalls all over the flow. And the solutions, like scanning a QR code with a separate
      device, are cumbersome and alien to most users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you&amp;#39;re going to teach
      someone how to deal with all of this, and all the potential pitfalls that might lock them out of your service, you almost
      might as well teach them how to use a cross-platform password manager like 1password.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes,
      passwords have problems. If you&amp;#39;re using them without a password manager, you&amp;#39;re likely to reuse them across
      multiple services, and if you do, all it takes is one service with awful password practices (like storing them in plain text
      rather than hashing them with something like bcrypt), and a breach will mean hackers might get access to all your other
      services.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But just because we have a real problem doesn&amp;#39;t mean that all proposed
      solutions are actually going to be better. And at the moment, I don&amp;#39;t see how passkeys are actually better, and,
      worse still, can become better. Unless you accept the idea that all your passwords should be tied to one computing
      ecosystem, and thus make it hard to use alternative computers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;A decent alternative to
      passkeys, if you need the extra layer of security, is to lean on email for the first login from a new device. Treating email
      as a second factor, but only on the first login from that device. Everyone has email, everyone understands email. (Just
      don&amp;#39;t force us all to go through magic links exclusively, as that&amp;#39;s a pain too for those who&amp;#39;ve
      actually adopted a password manager!).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bottom line, I&amp;#39;m disappointed to report that
      passkeys don&amp;#39;t appear worth the complexity of implementation (which is substantial!) nor the complexity and gotchas
      of the user experience. So we&amp;#39;re sticking to passwords and emails. Encouraging opt-in 2FA and password managers, but
      not requiring them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Passkeys seemed promising, but not all good intentions result in good
      solutions.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Optimize for bio cores first, silicon cores second</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;A big part of the reason that companies are going ga-ga over AI right now is the promise that it might materially
      lower their payroll for programmers. If a company currently needs 10 programmers to do a job, each have a cost of
      $200,000/year, then that&amp;#39;s a $2m/year problem. If AI could even cut off 1/4 of that, they would have saved half a
      million! Cut double that, and it&amp;#39;s a million. Efficiency gains add up quick on the bottom line when it comes to
      programmers!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I love Ruby! That&amp;#39;s why I work on Rails! For twenty
      years, it&amp;#39;s been clear to me that this is where the puck was going. Programmers continuing to become more expensive,
      computers continuing to become less so. Therefore, the smart bet was on making those programmers more productive EVEN AT THE
      EXPENSE OF THE COMPUTER!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s what so many programmers have a difficult time
      internalizing. They are in effect very expensive biological computing cores, and the real scarce resource. Silicon computing
      cores are far more plentiful, and their cost keeps going down. So as every year passes, it becomes an even better deal
      trading compute time for programmer productivity. AI is one way of doing that, but it&amp;#39;s also what tools like Ruby on
      Rails were about since the start.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s return to that $200,000/year programmer. You
      can rent 1 AMD EPYC core from Hetzner for $55/year (they sell them in bulk, $220/month for a box of 48, so 220 x 12 / 48 =
      55). That means the price of one biological core is the same as the price of 3663 silicon cores. Meaning that if you manage
      to make the bio core 10% more efficient, you will have saved the equivalent cost of 366 silicon cores. Make the bio core a
      quarter more efficient, and you&amp;#39;ll have saved nearly ONE THOUSAND silicon cores!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But
      many of these squishy, biological programming cores have a distinctly human sympathy for their silicon counterparts that
      overrides the math. They simply feel bad asking the silicon to do more work, if they could spend more of their own time to
      reduce the load by using less efficient for them / more efficient for silicon tools and techniques. For some, it seems to be
      damn near a moral duty to relieve the silicon of as many burdens they might believe they&amp;#39;re able carry
      instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And I actually respect that from an artsy, spiritual perspective! There
      &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; something beautifully wholesome about making computers do more with fewer resources. I still look
      oh-so-fondly back on the demo days of the Commodore 64 and Amiga. What those wizards were able to squeeze out of &lt;a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl6mXn_wHEw"&gt;a mere 4kb&lt;/a&gt; to make the computer dance in sound and picture
      was truly incredible.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It just doesn&amp;#39;t make much economic sense, most of the time.
      Sure, there&amp;#39;s still work at the vanguard of the computing threshold. Somebody&amp;#39;s gotta squeeze the last drop
      of performance out of that NVIDIA 4090, such that our 3D engines can raytrace at 4K and 120FPS. But that&amp;#39;s not the
      reality at most software businesses that are in the business of making business software (say that three times fast!).
      Computers have long since been way fast enough for that work to happen without heroic optimization
      efforts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that&amp;#39;s the kind of work I&amp;#39;ve been doing for said twenty years!
      Making business software and selling it as SaaS. That&amp;#39;s what an entire industry has been doing to tremendous profit
      and gainful employment across the land. It&amp;#39;s been a bull run for the ages, and it&amp;#39;s been mostly driven by
      programmers working in high-level languages figuring out business logic and finding product-market
      fit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So whenever you hear a discussion about computing efficiency, you should
      always have the squishy, biological cores in mind. Most software around the world is priced on their inputs, not on the
      silicon it requires. Meaning even small incremental improvements to bio core productivity is worth large additional
      expenditures on silicon chips. And every year, the ratio grows greater in favor of the bio
      cores.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least up until the point that we make them obsolete and welcome our AGI overlords!
      But nobody seems to know when or if that&amp;#39;s going to happen, so best you deal in the economics of the present day,
      pick the most productive tool chain available to you, and bet that happy programmers will be the best bang for your
      buck.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Why don't more people use Linux?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I &lt;a href="https://x.com/yacineMTB/status/1825361755133952326"&gt;saw a tweet&lt;/a&gt;
      asking: &amp;quot;If Linux is so good, why aren&amp;#39;t more people using it?&amp;quot; And it&amp;#39;s a fair question!
      It intuitively rings true until you give it a moment&amp;#39;s consideration. Linux is even free, so what&amp;#39;s stopping
      mass adoption, if it&amp;#39;s actually better? My response:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;If
      exercising is so healthy, why don&amp;#39;t more people do it?&lt;br&gt;If reading is so educational, why don&amp;#39;t more
      people do it?&lt;br&gt;If junk food is so bad for you, why do so many people eat
      it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world is full of free invitations to self-improvement that are
      ignored by most people most of the time. Putting it crudely, it&amp;#39;s easier to be fat and ignorant in a world of cheap,
      empty calories than it is to be fit and informed. It&amp;#39;s hard to resist the temptation of minimal
      effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And Linux isn&amp;#39;t minimal effort. It&amp;#39;s an operating system
      that demands more of you than does the commercial offerings from Microsoft and Apple. Thus, it serves as a dojo for
      understanding computers better. With a sensei who keeps demanding you figure problems out on your own in order to learn and
      level up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I totally understand why most computer users aren&amp;#39;t interested in an
      intellectual workout when all they want to do is browse the web or use an app. They&amp;#39;re not looking to become a black
      belt in computing fundamentals.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But programmers are different. Or ought to be different.
      They&amp;#39;re like firefighters. Fitness isn&amp;#39;t the purpose of firefighting, but a prerequisite. You&amp;#39;re a
      better firefighter when you have the stamina and strength to carry people out of a burning building on your shoulders than
      if you do not. So most firefighters work to be fit in order to serve that
      mission.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;d love to see more developers &lt;a
      href="https://omakub.org/"&gt;take another look at Linux&lt;/a&gt;. Such that they may develop better proficiency in the
      basic katas of the internet. Such that they aren&amp;#39;t scared to connect a computer to the internet without the cover of
      a cloud.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, if you&amp;#39;re able to figure out how to setup a modern build pipeline
      for JavaScript or even correctly configure IAM for AWS, you already have all the stamina you need for the Linux journey.
      Think about giving it another try. Not because it is easy, but because it is worth it.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Free speech isn't guaranteed to be forever</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;History is full of long stretches of dominance by noble ideas and despots, times of prosperity and of dark ages.
      Each of which must have seemed like they would never end to the people who lived through them. If you were a citizen of the
      Ottoman empire 1452, you probably didn&amp;#39;t imagining life any other way. Ditto the height of the Roman empire. Ditto
      today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Humans of all times have acclimated to their environment, their culture,
      and their politics. And while we&amp;#39;ve also always had historians and prophets proclaiming to know the future, through
      the tea leaves of the past or burning bushes, actually calling the advent of specific change at a specific time, with any
      degree of accuracy, has been and remains nearly impossible. It&amp;#39;s just that kind of
      planet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it was a piece of fiction, rather than actual history, that made me think of
      this yesterday, as I watching the first episode of HBO&amp;#39;s Game of Thrones prequel House of Dragons. It opens with the
      narration that the realm had been under sixty years of peaceful rule by King Jaehaerys Targaryen prior to the succession
      crisis of the plot. Sixty years.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this story spawned not just an abstract meditation on
      the waxing and waning of peace and history, but on what&amp;#39;s going on right now in the world we live in today,
      specifically with free speech.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;m old enough to remember when it was the left of
      the west that carried the banner of free speech. That defended lurid and violent rap music, first-person shooter video
      games, raging against the machine, exposing big pharma, protesting wars of all kinds. The counter culture, the dissidents,
      the live-and-let-live ethos of free expression, and the &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s like just your opinion,
      maaaan&amp;quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember learning about &lt;a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Party_of_America_v._Village_of_Skokie"&gt;the ACLU&amp;#39;s Jewish
      attorneys suing the government&lt;/a&gt; for the right of neo-Nazis in 1977 to march the streets of Skokie, Illinois. Men of
      principle, defending the right of their sworn enemies to exercise constitutional freedoms, such that that right might
      protect causes &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; believed in at a later day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That long
      stretch of peaceful rule and commitment to protecting free speech seems to have evaporated from much of the left today. In
      its place, we have the fig leaves of &amp;quot;misinformation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hate speech&amp;quot; failing to
      adequately cover the naked persecution of political adversaries. A fun-house mirror version of the right&amp;#39;s old
      &amp;quot;won&amp;#39;t somebody please think of the children&amp;quot; go-to argument for curbing free
      speech.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;In case you haven&amp;#39;t been following along in the last few weeks, let me catch
      you up. First, &lt;a
      href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/brazil-bans-x-outrage-spreads-elon-musks-social-media-platform-suspended"&gt;Brazil&amp;#39;s
      left-wing judiciary just banned X&lt;/a&gt; from their internet because this one judge couldn&amp;#39;t strong-arm the
      platform into banning his political enemies. Now he&amp;#39;s decreed that any citizen that dares access X via VPN will risk
      a fine amounting to almost a year&amp;#39;s median salary.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This barely two weeks after the
      &lt;a href="https://x.com/ThierryBreton/status/1823033048109367549"&gt;European Union&amp;#39;s Kommissar Thierry Buton
      threatened X with eviction&lt;/a&gt; from Europe, if Musk failed to censor &amp;quot;harmful content&amp;quot;. Specifically
      referencing the grave danger of featuring an interview with one of the candidates for the US presidency, Donald
      Trump.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, just two days ago, Robert Reich, the former US secretary of Labor under
      Clinton, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/30/elon-musk-wealth-power"&gt;called for the
      arrest of Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; on a similar pretext of &amp;quot;misinformation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hate&amp;quot;,
      echoing his fellow Brazilian and European censorship mongers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not exactly an idle threat,
      either, given &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/28/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-probe"&gt;the arrest of
      Telegram&amp;#39;s CEO&lt;/a&gt; by French authorities on adjacent accusations of failing to collaborate with state
      authorities on moderation and policing of speech on that platform.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And while all this is
      going on, the UK is accelerating &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GTn1He86oJk"&gt;its existing crackdown&lt;/a&gt;
      on spicy memes, indignant Facebook posts, and other expressions of frustration over the country&amp;#39;s handling of the
      mass migration issue that have been boiling over following a string of
      stabbings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are two common responses to this that seek to diminish the
      concern. One is to downplay these threats to free speech by playing up the danger posed by said
      &amp;quot;misinformation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hate speech&amp;quot;. That&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;yeah, of course we
      believe in free speech, but IN THIS CASE...&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;d say that&amp;#39;s probably the most common response
      I&amp;#39;ve heard from Canadians, Brits, and Europeans when I&amp;#39;ve voiced my concern over this
      issue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other is the more American response: This couldn&amp;#39;t happen here. We have
      the first amendment! It&amp;#39;ll protect us. Regardless of what bluster you hear from the likes of Reich and other
      would-be censors. And that&amp;#39;s also been my go-to calming pill for coping with this alarming rise in authoritarian
      censorship around the western world, given that I live here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then I think of the sixty
      years of peaceful rule under Jaehaerys. And how we&amp;#39;re just one succession crisis away from losing rights that have
      been taken for granted for several generations of Americans. It sounds paranoid, I know. Because any dystopian vision of the
      future usually does from the vantage point of a present that hasn&amp;#39;t yet tipped.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet
      just cause you&amp;#39;re paranoid doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re not after you. And I don&amp;#39;t even think you
      have to be all that paranoid to see that they really are after free speech all over the west! From Canada to Britain, from
      Brazil to Brussels. The momentum is deeply authoritarian at the moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I think
      you&amp;#39;d be right to worry that a grand turn of history is before us. But rather than throw up your hands, Private
      Hudson style, and say &amp;quot;Now what the fuck are we supposed to do? We&amp;#39;re in some real pretty shit now,
      man!&amp;quot;, I urge you to find your inner Corporal Hicks: &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s move like we got a
      purpose&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only way to defend free speech is to nuke the idea of benevolent censorship from
      orbit. Nobody has a monopoly on the truth, nobody can discern &amp;quot;misinformation&amp;quot; from truth consistently or
      without bias, and nobody can define &amp;quot;hate speech&amp;quot; in universally acceptable terms that don&amp;#39;t
      recall blasphemy laws of centuries past. The alternative, betting on more speech to counter bad speech, isn&amp;#39;t a
      guaranteed win every time, but it&amp;#39;s by far the best option we&amp;#39;ve found so far.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>For what it'll make of you</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always had an ambivalent relationship with goals. I don&amp;#39;t like goals that feel like
      checkpoints on a treadmill. They make you reach for a million dollars in revenue, celebrate for a second, and then turn the
      chase to five million the minute after. No thanks. But specific, material goals aren&amp;#39;t the only kind you can
      set.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a goal I remember setting that wasn&amp;#39;t like that. I
      remember seeing Kent Beck -- the creator of &lt;a
      href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658"&gt;eXtreme Programming&lt;/a&gt;
      and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smalltalk-Best-Practice-Patterns-Kent/dp/013476904X"&gt;my favorite
      programming style guide of all time&lt;/a&gt; -- on the conference stage at JAOO 2003. I was mesmerized by Kent&amp;#39;s
      command of the material and the audience. And I remember setting a goal of becoming as capable as that in the art of public
      speaking on technical topics.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also remember setting the goal of participating in the 24
      Hours of Le Mans after just a few years of getting behind the wheel of a racing car for the first time. I had barely become
      proficient enough to compete safely against other drivers, but had already progressed enough from the first time on track
      that I could extrapolate the trajectory. And have faith that I was going to get there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now
      there&amp;#39;s a fine line between goals that are ambitious and goals that are delusional. If I had set a goal to be the
      fastest driver in the world at age 30, after only earning my driver&amp;#39;s license at 25, I would have been delusional.
      Those odds wouldn&amp;#39;t just be long, they&amp;#39;d be impossible. And I don&amp;#39;t like to start a pursuit in
      vain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Same too, if, after watching Kent Beck on stage, I&amp;#39;d set a goal to repeat the
      feat the next year. That would have been delusional. Not only does it take time and practice and skill to become that good
      of a public speaker, I also needed to become knowledgeable enough about my domain to have something interesting to talk
      about.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in both cases, the racing and the speaking, I intuitively knew that it
      wasn&amp;#39;t just about the destination. If it was, there&amp;#39;d probably be many shortcuts I could have taken. But I
      wanted to take the long road. For what it would make of me. Jim Rohn &lt;a
      href="https://www.tiktok.com/@grind_buddy/video/7325191825118039329"&gt;expresses&lt;/a&gt; this sentiment
      beautifully:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Set a goal that&amp;#39;ll make you stretch that
      far.&lt;br&gt;For what it&amp;#39;ll make of you to achieve it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The greatest value in life is not what
      you get,&lt;br&gt;the greatest value in life is what you become.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was
      not about winning a race, but about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNQl0x6WS3M"&gt;becoming a racer&lt;/a&gt;.
      It was not about giving a speech, but about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqXjGiQ_D-A"&gt;becoming a
      speaker&lt;/a&gt;. Think about what you&amp;#39;d like to become more often than thinking about what you&amp;#39;d like to
      get.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-once-more-have-no-full-time-managers-at-37signals-f8611085" />
    <title>We once more have no full-time managers at 37signals</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;After experimenting with a number of management roles over the last few years, &lt;a
      href="https://37signals.com/"&gt;37signals&lt;/a&gt; is back to its original configuration: None. We once more have no
      full-time managers whose sole function is to organize or direct the work of others. Everyone doing management here does so
      on the side, next to their primary work as an individual contributor. Including Jason and I. And it
      works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say that there&amp;#39;s no managerial work at
      37signals. We still do yearly performance reviews, have onboarding duties for new colleagues, schedule on-call coverage, and
      supervise junior work. But instead of gathering all those responsibilities with a few full-time managers, we&amp;#39;ve
      distributed the load among the senior staff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This incentivizes a minimalist
      approach to management. Instead of lining up a recurring schedule of weekly one-on-ones, we drive status updates and
      check-ins by &lt;a href="https://basecamp.com/features/automatic-check-ins"&gt;automated questions&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of
      assigning five-six-seven reports to a single person, we make every lead and principle programmer responsible for one mentee.
      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With this distribution, there&amp;#39;s no longer a fixed forty hours for
      managerial duties to expand into, and so we dodge &lt;a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law"&gt;Parkinson&amp;#39;s Law&lt;/a&gt;. Because everyone we have doing
      a small share of the management would usually rather get back to their own work as quickly as possible. Some weeks that
      means the managerial overhead is literally zero, as everyone is just busy getting their work done, and nobody needs
      anything. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;You just can&amp;#39;t do that in a traditional setup. It&amp;#39;s impossible
      for a full-time manager to scale their inventions down to zero hours per week and still feel like they&amp;#39;re doing
      their job.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m sure that this arrangement would be difficult to maintain at a
      grand scale. When you&amp;#39;re dealing with hundreds or thousands of employees, you&amp;#39;re naturally going to yearn
      for more structure and hierarchy. But that&amp;#39;s not the case at around 60 people, which is where we
      are.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#39;s also not the case when you hire, mentor, and promote &lt;a
      href="https://37signals.com/podcast/hire-managers-of-one/"&gt;managers of one&lt;/a&gt;. People with both the competence and
      drive to set their own agenda and follow it autonomously. People who don&amp;#39;t need weekly one-on-ones with a manager to
      stay on track. People who thrive on long stretches of uninterrupted time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s the
      kind of people &lt;a href="https://37signals.com/jobs"&gt;we seek to hire&lt;/a&gt; and develop at 37signals. And I find
      that it&amp;#39;s easier to steer that development when someone&amp;#39;s primary manager is also their professional
      superior. You&amp;#39;re likely to learn faster and frankly respect that person more.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This
      is the old Steve Jobs quip about &amp;quot;they knew how to manage, but they didn&amp;#39;t know how to do
      anything&amp;quot; that followed &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QplyFXgIx7Q"&gt;his experience hiring
      professional managers&lt;/a&gt; rather than letting the best individual contributors do the management. I wouldn&amp;#39;t
      go that far. I do think there are plenty of professional managers who&amp;#39;ve had solid experience &amp;quot;doing
      things&amp;quot;, but I still think the general principle holds, if they&amp;#39;re not better at &amp;quot;doing
      things&amp;quot; than the people they&amp;#39;re managing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even so, it&amp;#39;s still a
      trade off. I&amp;#39;ve found that the hardest part of the managerial burden to distribute broadly is dealing with conflict
      and poor performance. There are a lot of senior staff willing and able to help mentor and manage juniors and peers who are
      on a solid trajectory and acting as managers of one. It&amp;#39;s a much smaller group who welcomes dealing with reports who
      can&amp;#39;t keep up or repeatedly gets lost.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;So for this to work, you have to realize the
      limitations of the manager-less arrangement. There&amp;#39;s got to be someone else in the organization who can direct or
      even take over when an employee needs strong, repeated &amp;quot;redirecting feedback&amp;quot; (what a euphemism!).
      That&amp;#39;s the deal. Those cases will have to bubble up to the top.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But is that really
      so bad? If cases of poor performance keeps bubbling up, there&amp;#39;s a fundamental problem somewhere in the process
      anyway, and that can usually only be definitively addressed by the top. Are we not hiring the right people? Are we unclear
      in our expectations? Are we too diffident in our feedback? These are root cause problems that require root cause
      reparations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When all this works, the result is astounding. Small teams of highly
      competent managers of one can progress at an unbelievable pace. Left to just do their job, they get it done, and are in turn
      rewarded with that precious job satisfaction of really making a direct, personal difference. There&amp;#39;s nothing better
      than shipping quickly alongside peers you respect highly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After twenty-plus years
      of running a company like this, I can tell you that I no longer have any interest in working any other way. Spending a
      couple of years with a more traditional structure was a wonderful experience because it cemented this fact. We&amp;#39;re
      going to make this company work without full-time managers or die trying.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Children of You</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;The birth rate is dropping all over the world. In some places, like South Korea (0.72), it is so low people are
      starting to &lt;a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-fertility-rate-dropped-fresh-record-low-2023-2024-02-28/"&gt;worry
      about a national extinction&lt;/a&gt;. In other places, &lt;a
      href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/612074/fertility-rates-in-european-countries/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20Faroe%20Islands,around%201.3%20children%20per%20woman."&gt;including
      all of Europe&lt;/a&gt; (average 1.5, Spain 1.29), it&amp;#39;s merely bad and alarming. And nobody seems to know exactly
      why. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even in Denmark, it&amp;#39;s now so low (1.5) that the government went from
      estimating a lack of 5,000 child care professionals to &lt;a
      href="https://politiken.dk/danmark/art9929156/Nye-b%C3%B8rnetal-ser-ud-til-at-afbl%C3%A6se-p%C3%A6dagogmanglen-%C2%BBDet-er-virkelig-en-gamechanger%C2%AB"&gt;suddenly
      looking at a 2,000 person surplus by 2035&lt;/a&gt;. Plans for kindergartens and schools are being rewritten in anticipation
      of far fewer kids in the coming years. At 1.5, Denmark&amp;#39;s population will shrink almost a fifth by 2050, and of
      course it&amp;#39;ll then be a mix of much older people with far fewer working-age individuals to support
      them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a reminder, just to stay level, a country needs a birth rate of 2.1. But by
      continent, only Africa is consistently above that level. The UN keeps revising back the year they project that &lt;a
      href="https://ourworldindata.org/un-population-2024-revision"&gt;the world&amp;#39;s population will peak at about 10
      billion&lt;/a&gt;. In 2022, they said 2086. In 2023, that became 2084. And of course the demographic threat isn&amp;#39;t
      just a shrinking globe, but that in the years leading up to that fact, the rate of old-to-young is going to be difficult for
      most countries to deal with.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s all the relatively far future, though. And what
      we should have learned by now is just how hard that future is to predict. Denmark literally went from one year to the next
      predicting a massive shortage in child care professionals that needed political intervention to realizing they
      wouldn&amp;#39;t need that after all.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But worse than being unable to predict the future, we
      don&amp;#39;t even seem to understand the present. There&amp;#39;s no comprehensive theory as to why this is happening all
      over the world and at the same time. There are a million theories, but the bulk of them seem mostly about advancing
      someone&amp;#39;s political priors. And the vast majority of them fall apart when tested against the local facts of
      countries as different as Denmark from South Korea to Italy to Canada.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#39;s the lack
      of religion! It&amp;#39;s the mental overload for women! It&amp;#39;s contraception! It&amp;#39;s not enough maternity
      leave! It&amp;#39;s too high pressure to achieve at work! It&amp;#39;s the rise of narcissism! It&amp;#39;s low
      testosterone! It&amp;#39;s hook-up culture!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#39;s no shortage of explanations (or
      accusations).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why this is happening either, but I do know this: Before
      having kids, I did not understand what it would be like. That might sound obvious, but I think it&amp;#39;s actually not. I
      understood what it was like to be a kid myself, yes. I understood what other people&amp;#39;s children were like, yes. And I
      understood all the reasons why parents might often be stressed. But I did not understand the core emotional and even
      spiritual transformation that actually having &lt;em&gt;my own children&lt;/em&gt; would
      induce.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what a transformation that was! Or was for me, I guess I should caveat. People
      react in a myriad of ways to becoming parents, and let&amp;#39;s just say not everyone accepts the burden with equal grace.
      But to me, it&amp;#39;s been perhaps the single biggest shift in perspective and probably the most rewarding life experience
      possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yet sentences like that, with words like &amp;quot;rewarding&amp;quot;
      or &amp;quot;transformation&amp;quot;, do not even begin to convey the reality, because it&amp;#39;s not possible to
      transmit its essence in words! I imagine it&amp;#39;s like explaining &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; to a person who
      can&amp;#39;t see color. Or the smell of the ocean to someone who&amp;#39;ve never been near a shore. Words will be very
      crude representations that will ultimately do little to represent reality.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But
      that&amp;#39;s all we have! Words. So let me try a few different approaches. One is that &lt;a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem"&gt;the trolley problem&lt;/a&gt; no longer becomes a problem let alone
      much of a moral dilemma. If that lever controls a train heading for my kids or &lt;em&gt;a million strangers&lt;/em&gt;,
      it&amp;#39;s not a hard choice at all. I don&amp;#39;t even have to think about it for a
      second.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Same too if the lever is me versus them. No hesitation, no trepidation.
      I&amp;#39;ll sacrifice myself with ease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Maybe this is what some people experience
      being part of the military in an existential fight for a nation&amp;#39;s survival. That they&amp;#39;re ready to die for
      the greater cause. But even so, I&amp;#39;d be surprised if there wasn&amp;#39;t at least a little bit of hesitation
      then!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And again, maybe this isn&amp;#39;t how everyone feels about their children. In fact,
      clearly it&amp;#39;s not. But I do think this is the most common feeling. An easy commitment to self sacrifice, and a
      willingness to do whatever it takes to keep them safe. That&amp;#39;s a transcendental shift in
      experience.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which may sound great, but shouldn&amp;#39;t be mistaken for
      &amp;quot;happiness&amp;quot;. Plenty of studies have shown that parents are actually the most &amp;quot;unhappy&amp;quot;
      in the prime child caring years, and it&amp;#39;s not hard to imagine why. Starting with the lack of sleep, the ever-present
      degrees of worry, and the sudden, abrupt limits on &amp;quot;me time&amp;quot;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It
      illustrates the difference between &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;happiness&amp;quot; perfectly. In almost all
      cases, children bring a deep, profound meaning to the life of those who have them. Happiness comes and goes, but the meaning
      of being directly connected by DNA to a human you brought into this world is ever
      lasting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now there are a million good reasons for why having kids is great for the
      world (whatever the Malthusian #degrowth fanatics claim), but it&amp;#39;s that selfish reason, the profound life experience
      and bond, that I think often slips out of the conversation, and thus consciousness of prospective parents. It&amp;#39;s easy
      to describe in words how having less time, less money, less freedom sounds like a raw deal. It&amp;#39;s very hard to
      describe the purpose granted by parenthood. That asymmetry clearly isn&amp;#39;t helping the
      case!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m trying to make it. The case for having
      children. To not let the asymmetry of explainable cons tip the scale over unexplainable pros. Contributing with your own DNA
      to the continuation of the species, and watching your own flesh and blood grow up, is a sublime experience. And while not
      accessible to all due to medical issues or otherwise, it&amp;#39;s accessible to most, and I think you&amp;#39;ll deeply
      regret not partaking if able and capable. I know I would have.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Merchants of complexity</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to sell simple, because simple looks easy, and who wants to pay for that? Of course, everyone
      &lt;em&gt;says&lt;/em&gt; they want something simple, but the way they buy reveals that they usually
      don&amp;#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is the secret that the merchants of complexity have long since
      figured out. That clever and sophisticated beats basic and straightforward most days in the market. Since both clever and
      sophisticated implies something special, and only what&amp;#39;s special command the premium
      dollar.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deep down, that&amp;#39;s what most people want. To feel special. That&amp;#39;s far
      more important than merely purchasing a solution. Basic, cheap, or even free options are for the common dolt, with simple
      needs and simple problems, goes this wicked intuition. Few people have the courage to admit their life and work
      isn&amp;#39;t that complicated.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;You see this syndrome all over the tech industry. Basic
      problems people could easily solve for themselves, cheaply and quickly, getting turned into scary and insurmountable
      challenges that only a sophisticated solution (usually on a subscription!) will
      cure.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because that&amp;#39;s the other side of this. There are rarely high margins in
      actually selling someone something that they then own. Much better to rent it to them. They&amp;#39;ll own nothing and
      you&amp;#39;ll convince them they should be happy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;By what sorcery? Fear, mostly. Vanity,
      sometimes. Sloth, occasionally. Pride, definitely. The more insecurities the merchants of complexity can trigger, the easier
      the sell.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the spell only binds as long as you choose to believe in it. If you decide
      tomorrow that all this mass and weight and expense isn&amp;#39;t worth it, it won&amp;#39;t be. It&amp;#39;s that simple and
      that hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whether that means &lt;a
      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/dare-to-connect-a-server-to-the-internet-01d25a07"&gt;daring to connect a computer to the
      internet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/how-to-recover-from-microservices-ce3803cc"&gt;dumping that
      micro-services monstrosity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://once.com/campfire"&gt;ditching Slack&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a
      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-tried-that-didn-t-work-d9c42fe1"&gt;going #nobuild&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s all within
      your power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what are you waiting for? Dare to be basic, babe.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Software estimates have never worked and never will</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;Since the dawn of computing, humans have sought to estimate how long it takes to build software, and for just as
      long, they&amp;#39;ve consistently failed. Estimating even medium-sized projects is devilishly difficult, and estimating
      large projects is virtually impossible. Yet the industry keeps insisting that the method that hasn&amp;#39;t worked for
      sixty years will definitely work on this next project, if we all just try a little harder. It&amp;#39;s the definition of
      delusional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The fundamental problem is that as soon as a type of software
      development becomes so routine that it would be possible to estimate, it turns into a product or a service you can just buy
      rather than build. Very few people need to build vanilla content management systems or e-commerce stores today, they just
      use WordPress or Shopify or one of the alternatives. Thus, the bulk of software development is focused on
      &lt;em&gt;novel&lt;/em&gt; work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But the thing about novel work is that nobody
      knows exactly what it should look like until they start building. For just as long as software industry has been failing to
      estimate the work, it&amp;#39;s also been deluding itself into thinking that you can specify novel work upfront, and produce
      something people actually want.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yet we&amp;#39;ve also tried that
      many times before! And nobody cared for the outcome. Because it invariably didn&amp;#39;t end up solving the real problems.
      The ones you could only articulate after building half of a wrong solution, changing direction, and then coming up with
      something better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&amp;#39;s time to accept this. Smart programmers have tried
      for decades, and they have repeatedly failed, just as folks fail today, when we try to cut against the grain of human
      ingenuity, and insist that software needs estimation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The solution is not to try
      harder nor to hope that this time is somehow different. It&amp;#39;s to change tactics. Give up on estimates, and embrace
      the alternative method for making software by using &lt;em&gt;budgets&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;a
      href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.2-chapter-03#setting-the-appetite"&gt;appetites&lt;/a&gt;, as we call them in &lt;a
      href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup"&gt;our Shape Up methodology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It
      turns out that programmers are actually surprisingly good at delivering great software on time, if you leave the scope open
      to negotiation during development. You&amp;#39;re not going to get &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what you asked for, but you
      wouldn&amp;#39;t want that anyway. Because what you asked for before you began building was based on the absolute worst
      understanding of the problem.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Great software is the product of trade-offs and concessions
      made while making progress. That&amp;#39;s how you cut with the grain of human nature. It&amp;#39;s the core realization
      that&amp;#39;s been driving us for decades at 37signals, and which has resulted in some wonderful products built by small
      teams punching way above their weight. We&amp;#39;ve incorporated it into Shape Up, but whether you use a specific
      methodology or not, giving up on estimates can help you ship better and sooner.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Where at least I know I'm free</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;I used to find the American self-image of being this uniquely freedom-loving, freedom-having people delusional.
      Sure, I&amp;#39;d think, you&amp;#39;re not North Korea or Venezuela, but is that really a standard worth celebration?
      Shouldn&amp;#39;t America compare itself to higher alternatives, like Europe or even the rest of the Anglosphere? Turns out
      I just needed to wait a little longer for the patriotic hymns to begin ringing
      true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Witness what&amp;#39;s going on in both the UK and the EU at the moment.
      There&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1uXt8PX8VY"&gt;shockingly draconian crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on
      &amp;quot;misinformation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hate speech&amp;quot;, the two stalwart euphemisms for &amp;quot;speech we
      don&amp;#39;t like&amp;quot;, going on in Britain in particular at the moment. Fast-track tribunals have been setup to hand
      out unbelievably harsh sentences for such terrible offenses as &amp;quot;anti-establishment rhetoric&amp;quot;, criticisms
      of mass migration, and &amp;quot;obscene gesticulations at the police&amp;quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, all
      this is happening in the context of violent riots. But weren&amp;#39;t The Enlightened Ones supposed to recognize the
      dangers of using a crisis to push through police-state measures? Wasn&amp;#39;t this what so many on the left were
      rightfully up in arms about regarding The Patriot Act in the US?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Meanwhile, the
      &lt;a href="https://x.com/ThierryBreton/status/1823033048109367549"&gt;EU is threatening&lt;/a&gt; the owner of X, Elon
      Musk, with severe consequences if he does not abide by its arbitrary definition of what defending us all against
      &amp;quot;misinformation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hate speech&amp;quot; looks like. And the new Digital Markets Act, which
      I&amp;#39;ve in the past applauded for its attempt to counter tech monopolies, is being wielded as the cudgel for this
      authoritarian crackdown. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is all very much in line with &lt;a
      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/go-truck-yourself-a14306d9"&gt;the authoritarian preview we got during the pandemic from
      Canada&lt;/a&gt;, which also pushed beyond the democratic Rubicon, and moved to shut down the bank accounts of people who
      donated to protesters, among other draconian injunctions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which brings me back to America,
      and the specifically the song &amp;quot;God Bless the USA&amp;quot;. My wife grew up singing this song in school. And I
      always thought that wasn&amp;#39;t only rather &lt;a
      href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/camp#dictionary-entry-3"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt;, but damn near indoctrination.
      But that sure does look different now.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to quote the main bit in full, just
      so we&amp;#39;re all on the same campy page about this song:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;If
      tomorrow all the things were gone&lt;br&gt;I worked for all my life&lt;br&gt;And I had to start again&lt;br&gt;With just my
      children and my wife&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I thank my lucky stars&lt;br&gt;To be living here
      today&lt;br&gt;&amp;#39;Cause the flag still stands for freedom&lt;br&gt;And they can&amp;#39;t take that
      away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I&amp;#39;m proud to be an American&lt;br&gt;Where at least I know
      I&amp;#39;m free&lt;br&gt;And I won&amp;#39;t forget the men who died&lt;br&gt;Who gave that right to me&lt;br&gt;And
      I&amp;#39;d gladly stand up next to you&lt;br&gt;And defend Her still today&lt;br&gt;&amp;#39;Cause there ain&amp;#39;t no
      doubt&lt;br&gt;I love this land&lt;br&gt;God Bless the U.S.A.
      &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I mean, I still smirk. Especially when watching
      &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KoXt9pZLGM"&gt;the music video&lt;/a&gt; and its kitsch depiction of American
      life. And yet - AND YET - it somehow now &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; ring poetically true.
      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;America&amp;#39;s first amendment, the constitutional right to free speech,
      including the right to &amp;quot;misinformation&amp;quot; and even &amp;quot;hate speech&amp;quot;, has proven a
      surprisingly effective and resilient bulwark against the new rise of censorship and blasphemy laws gaining steam across the
      Atlantic.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s what the song is on about with &amp;quot;but at least I know
      I&amp;#39;m free&amp;quot;!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m not an American. But I sure am becoming a lot
      more appreciative of the core principles my adopted country was founded on. (While keeping my eyes wide open to all its
      trade-offs and contradictions.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Americans should be proud of these principles.
      Whatever the age, there&amp;#39;ll always be blasphemous talk, offensive jokes, mean insults, and wild conspiracy theories
      (that occasionally turn out to be true!). I&amp;#39;d much rather live in a country that embraces everyone&amp;#39;s right
      to BE FULL OF SHIT than one that pretends it can declare a priori what&amp;#39;s true and what&amp;#39;s false or one that
      makes false equivalences between violence and speech.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Framework 13 has a new high-res screen!</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;The first laptop I ordered back when my Linux journey began &lt;a
      href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/imperfections-create-connections-bc87d630"&gt;was the Framework 13&lt;/a&gt;. I immediately
      liked a lot about it. The keyboard is a big step up over the MacBook Pro, primarily because of the 50% longer key travel.
      And I love the matte screen and 3:2 aspect ratio. Both feel way nicer for programming. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But
      running a 2256x1504 resolution on a 13.5&amp;quot; screen means a PPI of just 200, which is only barely acceptable for a
      &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/fonts-don-t-have-to-look-awful-on-windows-564c9d2f"&gt;crisp-font snob&lt;/a&gt; like
      myself, and below both the MacBook Air at 224 and the MacBook Pro at 254. This, more than even the difference in battery
      life, was why I kept looking around at other PC laptops.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I tried options from Tuxedo,
      Samsung, and Dell, but while all of them had something solid to offer, the entire package never spoke to me like the
      Framework did. And while I kept looking for something else, I realized that the Framework was really growing on me.
      Especially after figuring out that I could get a very enjoyable setup running at 200% resolution &lt;a
      href="https://github.com/basecamp/omakub/blob/master/install/desktop/set-framework-text-scaling.sh"&gt;but at a 0.8 font
      sizing with Linux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And after a few weeks, I accepted that the slightly
      less crisp screen was worth the sacrifice to enjoy the rest of the amazing Framework package. And even if you could have
      offered me the MacBook Pro&amp;#39;s 254 PPI display on this machine, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have done the swap, after the 3:2
      aspect ratio and matte finish won me over.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now Framework has fixed it! They&amp;#39;ve
      just released a new 13.5&amp;quot; screen running a 2880x1920 resolution for a MacBook Pro-beating 256 PPI! And it&amp;#39;s
      still matte and 3:2! AND 120HZ! Hallelujah!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What&amp;#39;s even cooler is that
      this new screen can be retrofitted to existing Framework laptops. And that&amp;#39;s exactly what I&amp;#39;ve done.
      It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://frame.work/products/display-kit?v=FRANJF0001"&gt;a $269 upgrade&lt;/a&gt;, so it&amp;#39;s
      not cheap, but it&amp;#39;s a hellavu lot cheaper than buying a whole new computer. Not to mention way less
      wasteful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The installation is involved enough that you feel like you&amp;#39;ve made a real
      personal contribution to your hardware, but without feeling complicated or onerous. I probably had the swap done in about
      five minutes. No special tooling needed. Very cool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And the screen itself is just
      wonderful. The text is considerably crisper than a MacBook Air, and fully on par with a MacBook Pro. The response time has
      also been improved over the last Framework screen, so where really keen eyes could detect some ghosting on fast moving
      objects with the old display, like a white mouse hand on a black background, that&amp;#39;s totally gone now. Oh, and you no
      longer need the 0.8 text hack for Linux to look right at 200%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now, it&amp;#39;s
      not totally perfect. There&amp;#39;s a small battery hit if you run it at 120hz on battery, because Linux still &lt;a
      href="https://9to5linux.com/gnome-46-to-ship-with-experimental-variable-refresh-rate-vrr-support"&gt;only has experimental
      support for variable refresh rates&lt;/a&gt;, and in my testing, it still needs more work (but apparently the next version
      of Gnome will sort this). But you can just set it to 60hz when on the go, and you&amp;#39;ll still get those roughly 6 hours
      of mixed use from the 61wh battery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As you can tell, I really like this new
      screen. It takes the last reservation I had about the Framework 13 and turns it into a key strength. In fact, I&amp;#39;d go
      so far as to say that this is the best looking laptop screen I&amp;#39;ve ever used for programming. The combination of 256
      PPI, matte covering, 3:2 aspect ratio, and 120hz is amazing for working with
      text.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m sure a video editor would still prefer Apple&amp;#39;s 16:10
      aspect ratio, glossy display, and color-corrected profile of a MacBook Pro. But for programmers? The Framework is
      better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And it&amp;#39;s &lt;a
      href="https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-13-gen-amd/configuration/new"&gt;such a good deal in its AMD version&lt;/a&gt;.
      You can get a 7640U with the new screen, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage for just around $1,200. Even slightly cheaper if
      you just get the RAM and storage from Amazon. That&amp;#39;s a ton of amazing computer for the money (and almost half of
      what a MacBook Pro with 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage costs!). It&amp;#39;s what I use as my daily-driver
      laptop.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good job, Framework!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;figure class="attachment

    <title>Cookie banners show everything that's wrong with the EU</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;Companies have spent billions on cookie banner compliance only to endlessly annoy users with no material
      improvement to their privacy, but this unsightly blight is still with us (and the rest of the internet!). All because the EU
      has no mechanism for self-correcting its legislative failures, even with years of evidence in the bag. The bureaucratic maze
      almost guarantees that all the noble intentions eventually find a dead end in which to get stuck. What a waste.
      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&amp;#39;s this example that all enthusiasm for European tech legislation
      should be set against. The fact that cookie banners still exist. And that the bureaucratic drag they have created across
      Europe (and the rest of the world) is ludicrously disproportionate to whatever theoretical value these awful overlays
      actually provide. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It makes it hard to cheer for even much-needed antitrust action, like the
      Digital Markets Act. Because if the EU can screw up something as basic as cookie banners this bad, and prove so incapable
      and uninterested in re-calibrating its approach, what hope is there for the thornier
      issues?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;What made me think of cookie banners today was the discussion about Europe&amp;#39;s
      new AI legislation. Which even &lt;a
      href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-08-01/europe-s-new-ai-rules-have-us-tech-in-mind-they-might-miss"&gt;the
      architect of the law is now having second thoughts&lt;/a&gt; about. Because like many modern European laws, it&amp;#39;s a
      vague, posturing, and suffocating mess that&amp;#39;s way too specific about things it fails to prove the ability to
      understand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#39;s also just an embarrassing illustration of Europe&amp;#39;s
      third-tier status in technology. So little of the core tech innovation that&amp;#39;s driving the future, in AI or
      otherwise, is happening in Europe. And when it does happen there, it&amp;#39;s usually just incubation, which then heads for
      America or elsewhere as soon as its ready to make a real impact on the
      world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Europe is in desperate need for a radical rethink on how it legislates
      tech. The amount of squandered potential from smart, capable entrepreneurs on the old continent is tragic. It
      needn&amp;#39;t be like this. But if you want different outcomes, you have to start doing different things.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Finding acoustical delight in THE THOCK</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;Before diving into the world of mechanical keyboards, I&amp;#39;d never heard the word &amp;quot;thock&amp;quot;
      before. But I soon learned that it describes one of those strangely seductive sounds you can produce from pressing the keys
      on a keyboard tuned for acoustical joy. And now, dammit, I&amp;#39;ve acquired a taste for this type of ear candy, and I
      can&amp;#39;t stop smiling as I type with a tune.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thock isn&amp;#39;t the only type of sound
      that connoisseurs of keyboard acoustics clamor for, mind you. There&amp;#39;s also the clack, and even the creamy. But I
      think it&amp;#39;s fair to say that thock is perhaps the most sought after. It&amp;#39;s hard to describe exactly what it
      sounds like with words, so if you&amp;#39;re curious, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxC8ItHUkiM"&gt;checkout
      this video from Hipyo Tech&lt;/a&gt; -- a YouTuber with more than a million followers who just reviews keyboards! This is
      one where he reviews the Lofree Flow, the keyboard I&amp;#39;m typing these very words
      on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even a video doesn&amp;#39;t quite do it justice, because half the satisfaction of
      hearing that thock comes from it being a response to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; fingers dancing across the keyboard.
      You&amp;#39;re making this odd music simply by writing an email or fixing some code. Like a snake charmer mesmerizing a
      serpent.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now mechanical keyboards have been a niche hobby for programmers for a long time,
      but I never really cared to give it a proper inquiry before. I was happy with the standard Apple Magic Keyboard for many,
      many years. Hell, I was even happy with the most despised Magic Mouse. It just didn&amp;#39;t seem like a problem that was
      worth any attention to solve.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there goes the misconception. Mechanical keyboards
      don&amp;#39;t solve any problems. In fact, if anything, they bring quite a few with them! Batteries usually don&amp;#39;t
      last as long, in part because many of them have RBG lights, and they can be annoyingly loud if you&amp;#39;re around others.
      Yet that misses the point. Taking greater joy from such a mundane activity as typing is one of those rare daily treats that
      just makes life a little better, a little more interesting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#39;s also a benign
      rabbit hole of lingo, knowledge, aesthetics, and preference. Kinda like mechanical watches, but mercifully more affordable.
      While you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; spend hundreds of dollars on a single luxury mechanical keyboard, there&amp;#39;s a huge
      variety of incredible models available from around $100-$200. (I wish more of my rewarding hobbies were that light on the
      wallet!).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And as you dive deeper, you learn not just about the difference between thock and
      clack. But about pre-lubed stabilizers, gasket flex, 2.4ghz polling rate advantages, key-cap designs, north vs sound facing
      LEDs, tactile vs linear switches, and about a hundred other nerdy details that go into making a great mechanical keyboard. I
      absolutely love leveling up on a new domain like this! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I also love is the incredible
      display of capitalism in this space. I can scarcely believe the variety of choice for something so niche as a mechanical
      keyboard! There are literally hundreds of manufacturers all competing on nailing these nerdy details, and they&amp;#39;re
      doing it at ever more affordable price points. The sheer variety and depth of this market would make Adam Smith
      blush.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can see this in the evolution over just the past few years. It used to be that to get a truly
      delightful mechanical keyboard, you had to built it yourself. Which meant buying an empty shell of a board, pick just the
      right switches, insert those switches, then get some lube to make said switches properly smooth, and on, and on. And you can
      still do that, of course, but the prebuilt boards that are now available for just a few hundred dollars at most have caught
      up with where the keyboard nerds wanted the typing world to be all along.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of you may
      already be deep into the cave of mechanical keyboards and chuckle at what took me so long to discover the entrance, but
      that&amp;#39;s exactly why I&amp;#39;m writing this. I had a few false starts in the mechanical keyboard world with boards
      from Keychron that I didn&amp;#39;t really enjoy, so I just thought this wasn&amp;#39;t a world for me. And I&amp;#39;m sure
      plenty of others either did the same or were turned off by the prospect of spending hours putting their own bespoke board
      together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So allow me to recommend the two boards that turned my opinion around: The near-silent &lt;a
      href="https://varmilo.com/products/minilo75"&gt;Varmilo Milo 75&lt;/a&gt; and the creamy, thocky &lt;a
      href="https://www.lofree.co/products/lofree-flow-the-smoothest-mechanical-keyboard"&gt;Lofree Flow 84&lt;/a&gt;. Both look
      amazing, feel amazing, and make a mockery of the $100 Apple Magic Keyboard that I thought was all I ever needed for so long.
      If you make a living from typing on a computer all day, I think you owe it to yourself to see if a mechanical board might
      not just add a bit of extra delight to your daily grind. I&amp;#39;d be surprised if it didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    <title>Living with Linux and Android after two decades of Apple</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;It now seems laughable that only a few months ago, I was questioning whether I&amp;#39;d actually be able to
      switch off the Apple stack and stick to my choice. That&amp;#39;s what two decades worth of entrenched habits will do to
      your belief in change! But not only was it possible, it&amp;#39;s been immensely enjoyable. What seemed so difficult at
      first now appears trivial, since it&amp;#39;s been done.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s not a critique of
      the Apple ecosystem per se. Apple continues to make great hardware and pretty good software too. And I think accepting that
      fact from the get go actually makes sticking to a switch more likely to succeed. Falling in love with something new is a
      better and healthier motivator than hating something old.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s been my experience
      with Linux in particular. I&amp;#39;ve come to love the setup I&amp;#39;ve enshrined in the &lt;a
      href="https://omakub.org/"&gt;Omakub&lt;/a&gt; project. It does a whole host of things much nicer than the old macOS walled
      garden experience, on top of the fact that running an open source operating system simply feels right for someone who owes
      their entire career to open source. It&amp;#39;s a positive vision: I really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like what Linux
      has to offer these days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&amp;#39;s a similar feeling, albeit not as strong,
      with the switch to Android. I don&amp;#39;t have any illusions that Google is any gentler of a corporate giant than Apple.
      The two have very similar ideas about extracting monopoly rents from their respective app stores. But the slogan that
      Android is more open is actually true.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now plenty of people don&amp;#39;t really care about
      that openness, and that&amp;#39;s fine. But I do. I care about being able to &lt;a
      href="https://www.fortnite.com/mobile/android"&gt;download the Fortnite APK straight from Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, and being
      able to play our favorite family game with the kids, without having to ask someone for permission. Sure, it could be a bit
      more convenient if the game was available in the Play Store, but spending another two minutes doing the direct install is
      nothing against the hundreds of hours we&amp;#39;ve spent playing since.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The same is true in
      terms of customization. I&amp;#39;m running this beautiful, minimal launcher called &lt;a
      href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.olauncher&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;olauncher&lt;/a&gt;, which turns Android
      into a far less addictive mobile experience by replacing icons and app drawers with a simple set of text links. It&amp;#39;s
      great. And it&amp;#39;s the kind of stuff you can only really do properly on Android, because replacing the default launcher
      is possible.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Getting out of the Apple rut has also lead me to discover an amazing new world
      of both software and hardware. Solutions that I just wasn&amp;#39;t in the market for after settling into an Apple grove
      over the years. Since switching to Linux, I&amp;#39;ve picked up &lt;a href="https://neovim.io/"&gt;Neovim&lt;/a&gt; as my
      new editor of choice, I&amp;#39;ve fallen in love with the &lt;a
      href="https://frame.work/products/laptop13-diy-intel-ultra-1"&gt;Framework 13&lt;/a&gt; laptop, and recently, I&amp;#39;ve
      even gotten into mechanical keyboards (the current choice being the &lt;a
      href="https://nuphy.com/products/air75-v2"&gt;NuPhy Air75&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s what a
      change of scenery can do for you. Force you to open your eyes to what else is out there. And in turn introduce you to new
      ways of doing and being. That&amp;#39;s a gift in and of itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m
      not telling you any of this to convince you to give up your Mac or your iPhone. People who love their Apple gear
      aren&amp;#39;t going to be convinced by an alternative positive vision because they&amp;#39;re simply not in the market for
      one. That&amp;#39;s where I was for a long time. Just not interested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&amp;#39;m
      telling you this in case your Apple relationship isn&amp;#39;t quite so hunky dory. In case their recent trajectory and
      relationship with developers might have been bugging you too. Because it&amp;#39;s in that situation you really need to know
      that the alternatives are not just present, they&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. Their value isn&amp;#39;t defined as
      not-Apple. There&amp;#39;s no valor in that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Linux is wonderful, is flawed, is
      messy, is beautiful, is nerdy, is different. Android is customizable, is open, is fragmented, is less polished, is
      experimental. All the pros and the cons are true at the same time. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it&amp;#39;s a
      compelling adventure to discover whether the trade-offs speak to you. Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to take the trip, but give it
      at least two weeks (if not two months!), and don&amp;#39;t think of the journey as a way to find the same home in a
      different place. Be open to a new home, in a new way, in a new place. You might just like it.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Visions of the future</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;Nothing gets me quite as fired up as discovering the future early and undistributed. That feeling of realizing
      that something is simply better, and the only reason it hasn&amp;#39;t taken off yet is because the world hasn&amp;#39;t
      realized it. It&amp;#39;s amazing, and it&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;m feeling about Linux right now. That &amp;quot;how did I
      not know it was this good&amp;quot; sensation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I felt the same way about the Mac
      back in 2001. And Ruby in 2003. And company chat with Campfire in 2005. And, fast forward, now with #nobuild, Hotwire, and
      even exiting the cloud. When I discover a path that seems like a clear shortcut, it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter if
      it&amp;#39;s poorly paved at first. As long as it appears to take us somewhere better, laying the bricks and clearing the
      brush is incidental.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#39;s about seeing that end state. Where what&amp;#39;s right in
      front of us now, rough and unpolished as it may be, can be transformed, if we put in the effort, that inspires me to keep
      going.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, half the fun is the adventure. We should always be pushing toward new horizons,
      even if some of them inevitably will end up in dead ends. But the other half is watching things genuinely compound for the
      better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Take web development. It&amp;#39;s incredible how much conceptual
      complexity we&amp;#39;ve been able to compress in the last decade, and particularly in the last half of a decade. It
      wasn&amp;#39;t just one thing, it was all the things. It was browsers getting better, mobile CPUs getting faster, #nobuild
      becoming possible, Hotwire showing an alternate route. Each substantial, yes, but together epoch altering. A new
      dawn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Following such a sense of wanderlust requires a certain disagreeableness.
      Even arrogance. A steadfast belief that it&amp;#39;s possible that you might actually have found a better way. Whether that
      turns out to be true or not. You have to believe that it&amp;#39;s possible. That the market place of ideas isn&amp;#39;t
      perfectly efficient or perfectly rational. That it hasn&amp;#39;t priced it all in, and that you could invest in upcoming
      concepts for an intellectual profit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You&amp;#39;re never going to be right about
      everything, but a life spent without taking at least a few bets on being early on an idea is one not lived to the fullest.
      Dare a little. Roll the dice every now and then. Come along for an adventure whether its heads or tails.&lt;/div&gt;
